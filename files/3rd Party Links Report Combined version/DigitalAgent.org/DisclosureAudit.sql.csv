<p>For more information regarding college savings plans, please visit <a href=""http://www.collegesavings.org/"">www.collegesavings.org</a>. Participation in a 529 Plan does not guarantee the investment return on contributions, if any, will be adequate to cover future tuition and other higher education expenses. State programs vary and therefore you should carefully review individual program documents before investing or sending money. Federal income tax on the earnings and a 10 percent penalty on distributions for non-qualified expenses may apply.</p>

<p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs): Penalties may apply to early withdrawals. Fair market value of CDs when sold may be worth more or less than face value. The FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount (SMDIA) is $250,000. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.</p>

<p>RBC Wealth Management does not provide tax or legal advice. All decisions regarding the tax or legal implications of your investments should be made in connection with your independent tax or legal advisor.</p>

<p>Investment and insurance products offered through RBC Wealth Management are not insured by the FDIC or any other federal government agency, are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank or any bank affiliate, and are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.</p>
