The federal government has tried to prop up the economy to cope with an unprecedented cataclysm. Washington has already passed $2.3 trillion in relief for households and businesses. When we finally enter into the post-crisis period, the business and economic context will likely not have returned to its pre-crisis state. The business landscape has changed fundamentally; we think tomorrow&rsquo;s environment will be different, but no less rich in possibilities for those who are prepared.</p>

<p>Many people on the verge of retirement will be forced to make a decision about their pension that is irrevocable. They will be asked whether they want to take their pension benefit(s) in the form of a lump sum payment or monthly payments for the rest of their life and/or their spouse&rsquo;s life. If that isn&rsquo;t complicated enough, if one is inclined to choose the annuity, there are many forms of the annuity: Straight Life Annuity, Joint and Survivor, or Period Certain.</p>

<p>With so many considerations, where does one begin?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are you worried about outliving your money?</li>
	<li>Are you worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of your pension payment?</li>
	<li>Does your family need spousal benefit?</li>
	<li>Are you comfortable investing? If so, how much risk does one take?</li>
	<li>Are you a big spender? Do you need a governor on your spending?</li>
	<li>Do you need the money? Is your retirement income covered from other resources?</li>
	<li>What is the financial state of the pension?</li>
	<li>Do you prefer simplicity in your&nbsp;wealth planning, or are you comfortable with a little more complexity if there are benefits?</li>
</ul>

<p>As one can see, this decision is potentially complex and certainly individual to each person. As we enter 2021, this decision will also be affected by the significant decrease in interest rates in 2020. A decrease in interest rates will, generally, require pension funds to reserve larger lump sums for participants in order to protect the required annuity payments. This can make the lump sum more appealing in some cases.</p>

<p>But, which option is correct for your&nbsp;financial plan?</p>

<p>Should you, or someone you know, have questions about their pension, or which option to take, our Base Camp event on April 22nd will be a great place to start to learn more information about this decision.</p>

The purpose of the call is to discuss bringing the dream of owning a vineyard and making your very own premium quality wine to reality.</p>

<p>In 2005, Michael went on what he thought would be a three-week vacation to Argentina. Falling in love with the Mendoza wine region, he co-founded (with Pablo Gimenez-Riili) The Vines of Mendoza. Their idea was to allow people who are passionate about wine to own small vineyards and transform themselves into winemakers. They now have over 230 vineyard owners, more than 170 award-winning wines, and the celebrated Vines Resort &amp; Spa (ranked as the best hotel in Argentina and #25 in the world by Travel &amp; Leisure). The Vines of Mendoza has become a unique community of winemakers who share a sense of adventure and the belief that &ldquo;nada es imposible&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now Michael, as CEO also of The Vines, is leading the expansion efforts, creating a global membership network of vineyards and wineries, which will enable wine lovers to become winemakers in 12 iconic wine regions throughout the world. Michael&rsquo;s personal wines are called Uco&rsquo;s Playground, after his black Lab, Maria Uco, who has been his constant companion in this wine adventure at the foot of the Andes.</p>
