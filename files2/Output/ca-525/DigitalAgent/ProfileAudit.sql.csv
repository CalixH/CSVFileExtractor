It&rsquo;s as simple as that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re counting on me to get it right.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Bill was born in Denver but grew up in mostly rural south Texas. His father and mother ran Varner-Hogg State Park, a 52 acre spread near West Columbia, Texas for over a quarter century. He learned from both of them the value of finishing the task at hand, no matter how difficult, and that has served him well at every station in life.<br />
<br />
He graduated from Southwestern University with a degree in Biology and Chemistry. He would spend a few years with Dow Chemical as a Technical Service Chemist before embarking on a 23-year career with Merrill Lynch. While at Merrill Lynch, he took on the 2-year task of getting his CFP, or Certified Financial Planner designation.<br />
<br />
Along the way, Bill also found the time to complete an MBA at Texas A&amp;M University.<br />
<br />
He arrived at RBC Wealth Management a little over three years ago, and he admits with a healthy dose of humility that he is one of the lucky ones, because this role gives him a chance to do what he does best every day. &ldquo;I love to learn, and I really like sharing what I learn with my clients,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is a partnership, and the good people I&nbsp; work for need a steady hand on the wheel. I believe I provide that.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
He has always admired country doctors, those selfless souls who dedicate their lives to the health of their communities. His grandfather was a doctor, and one of his mentors was as well. Bill once even thought about going into the medical field himself.<br />
<br />
Instead, he has devoted his life to the financial health of his clients, and frankly, he cares as much as any physician ever cared for a patient. His knowledge allows&nbsp; him to administer preventative medicine to keep their portfolios healthy and&nbsp;vibrant.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s a mission he relishes, and it too has some unforgettable moments. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had people invite me to a house warming and stand up in front of everyone and say &lsquo;This is the house that Bill made possible.&rsquo; And, I get to see parents send their kids off to college without all the financial stress that often accompanies it, just because we made good decisions along the way.

".ca",".ca","Bill Cariker","Texas Star Investment Group","PERSONAL","Bill Cariker","en_US","<p>Bill Cariker understands what lies at the core of this important work that he does every day for his clients at RBC Wealth Management: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tasked with being a good steward with my client&rsquo;s money. It&rsquo;s as simple as that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re counting on me to get it right.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Bill was born in Denver but grew up in mostly rural south Texas. His father and mother ran Varner-Hogg State Park, a 52 acre spread near West Columbia, Texas for over a quarter century. He learned from both of them the value of finishing the task at hand, no matter how difficult, and that has served him well at every station in life.<br />
<br />
He graduated from Southwestern University with a degree in Biology and Chemistry. He would spend a few years with Dow Chemical as a Technical Service Chemist before embarking on a 23-year career with Merrill Lynch. While at Merrill Lynch, he took on the 2-year task of getting his CFP, or Certified Financial Planner designation.<br />
<br />
Along the way, Bill also found the time to complete an MBA at Texas A&amp;M University.<br />
<br />
He arrived at RBC Wealth Management a little over three years ago, and he admits with a healthy dose of humility that he is one of the lucky ones, because this role gives him a chance to do what he does best every day. &ldquo;I love to learn, and I really like sharing what I learn with my clients,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is a partnership, and the good people I&nbsp; work for need a steady hand on the wheel. I believe I provide that.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
He has always admired country doctors, those selfless souls who dedicate their lives to the health of their communities. His grandfather was a doctor, and one of his mentors was as well. Bill once even thought about going into the medical field himself.<br />
<br />
Instead, he has devoted his life to the financial health of his clients, and frankly, he cares as much as any physician ever cared for a patient. His knowledge allows&nbsp; him to administer preventative medicine to keep their portfolios healthy and&nbsp;vibrant.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s a mission he relishes, and it too has some unforgettable moments. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had people invite me to a house warming and stand up in front of everyone and say &lsquo;This is the house that Bill made possible.&rsquo; And, I get to see parents send their kids off to college without all the financial stress that often accompanies it, just because we made good decisions along the way. It doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bill is married to Lynne, and they live in Austin, Texas.</p>","Senior Vice President - Financial Advisor","Senior Portfolio Manager - Portfolio Focus","","CFP®, CIMA®, CRPC®","","AZ, CA, CO, DC, FL, HI, MA, MN, MS, NC, NM, NV, OR, SC, TX, VT, WA","","","","","","","","","","",""

It&rsquo;s as simple as that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re counting on me to get it right.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bill was born in Denver but grew up in mostly rural south Texas. His father and mother ran Varner-Hogg State Park, a 52 acre spread near West Columbia, Texas for over a quarter century. He learned from both of them the value of finishing the task at hand, no matter how difficult, and that has served him well at every station in life.<br /><br />He graduated from Southwestern University with a degree in Biology and Chemistry. He would spend a few years with Dow Chemical as a Technical Service Chemist before embarking on a 23-year career with Merrill Lynch. While at Merrill Lynch, he took on the 2-year task of getting his CFP, or Certified Financial Planner designation.<br /><br />Along the way, Bill also found the time to complete an MBA at Texas A&amp;M University.<br /><br />He arrived at RBC Wealth Management a little over three years ago, and he admits with a healthy dose of humility that he is one of the lucky ones, because this role gives him a chance to do what he does best every day. &ldquo;I love to learn, and I really like sharing what I learn with my clients,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is a partnership, and the good people I&nbsp; work for need a steady hand on the wheel. I believe I provide that.&rdquo;<br /><br />He has always admired country doctors, those selfless souls who dedicate their lives to the health of their communities. His grandfather was a doctor, and one of his mentors was as well. Bill once even thought about going into the medical field himself.<br /><br />Instead, he has devoted his life to the financial health of his clients, and frankly, he cares as much as any physician ever cared for a patient. His knowledge allows&nbsp; him to administer preventative medicine to keep their portfolios healthy and&nbsp;vibrant.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s a mission he relishes, and it too has some unforgettable moments. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had people invite me to a house warming and stand up in front of everyone and say &lsquo;This is the house that Bill made possible.&rsquo; And, I get to see parents send their kids off to college without all the financial stress that often accompanies it, just because we made good decisions along the way. It doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Bill is married to Lynne, and they live in Austin, Texas.</p>","Senior Vice President - Financial Advisor","Senior Portfolio Manager - Portfolio Focus","","CFP®, CIMA®, CRPC®","","AZ, CA, CO, DC, FL, HI, MA, MN, MS, NC, NM, NV, OR, SC, TX, VT, WA","","","","","","","","","","",""
