&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;RBC Wealth Management has a long history of embracing stewardship values. Our clients can expect their best interests to be placed first, and our communities can expect a partner who invests in improving the quality of life in the locales where we do business. The&amp;nbsp;Hannah Hoselton Nehl&amp;nbsp;Group appreciates these values and we are proud to be involved with, and to support, various groups in our community.

&lt;div&gt;Tom served on the Board of Directors for &lt;a href=""http://www.ccslc.org"" target=""_blank""&gt;Catholic Community Services of Lane County&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more than a dozen years, including two terms as President of the Board, and he currently remains an active supporter of this great organization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CCSLC is one of the largest social services agencies in Lane County, providing housing, food, counseling, emergency shelter, utilities subsidies, and case management services for tens of thousands of people each year.&lt;/div&gt;

     The formula Barron's uses to rank advisors is proprietary. It has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record.

     &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With over 20 years of industry experience, Jennifer brings a wealth of knowledge and a high-level of responsiveness to her client relationships. Along with her strong New England ties, she graduated from Keene State College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. Interestingly, Jennifer first entered the industry as an intern during her senior year at college. While the position was not meant to lead to a full-time career, she stayed on when summer ended and, as she jokes, “Never had to complete another resume…” because the internship turned into a full-time position. She has been with the same team ever since, although it has grown and moved to RBC Wealth Management in 2006. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Today she holds the Series 3, 7 and 65 securities licenses, specializes in insurance and annuities products, and has earned the designation of Accredited Asset Management Specialist® through the 
     &lt;a href=""https://www.cffp.edu/""&gt;College for Financial Planning&lt;/a&gt;. She has also participated in numerous additional studies, including courses at the Advest Institute at Harvard University. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Community involvement is an important part of Jennifer’s personal and professional life as well. She is the past director and current committee member, as well as a regular financial supporter of the Webster Youth Soccer Program; and is a current board member and a 25-plus year volunteer and financial supporter of the 
     &lt;a href=""http://www.capitalregionfoodprogram.org/""&gt;Capital Region Food Program&lt;/a&gt;, a not-for-profit organization helping to reduce hunger in the Greater Concord Area. She also volunteers regularly for the Friends of 
     &lt;a href=""http://www.capitalregionfoodprogram.org/""&gt;Merrimack River Greenway Trail&lt;/a&gt;, is an active volunteer within the Merrimack Valley School District.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Currently residing in Webster, New Hampshire with her husband and son, Jennifer spends her free time camping in northern New England and the Canadian Maritimes, cooking and gardening with her family.
    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Bill Cariker understands what lies at the core of this important work that he does every day for his clients at RBC Wealth Management: “I’m tasked with being a good steward with my client’s money. It’s as simple as that,” he says. “They’re counting on me to get it right.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill was born in Denver but grew up in mostly rural south Texas. His father and mother ran Varner-Hogg State Park, a 52 acre spread near West Columbia, Texas for over a quarter century. He learned from both of them the value of finishing the task at hand, no matter how difficult, and that has served him well at every station in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He graduated from Southwestern University with a degree in Biology and Chemistry. He would spend a few years with Dow Chemical as a Technical Service Chemist before embarking on a 23-year career with Merrill Lynch. While at Merrill Lynch, he took on the 2-year task of getting his CFP, or Certified Financial Planner designation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, Bill also found the time to complete an MBA at Texas A&amp;amp;M University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He arrived at RBC Wealth Management a little over three years ago, and he admits with a healthy dose of humility that he is one of the lucky ones, because this role gives him a chance to do what he does best every day. “I love to learn, and I really like sharing what I learn with my clients,” he says. “This is a partnership, and the good people I&amp;nbsp; work for need a steady hand on the wheel. I believe I provide that.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has always admired country doctors, those selfless souls who dedicate their lives to the health of their communities. His grandfather was a doctor, and one of his mentors was as well. Bill once even thought about going into the medical field himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, he has devoted his life to the financial health of his clients, and frankly, he cares as much as any physician ever cared for a patient. His knowledge allows&amp;nbsp; him to administer preventative medicine to keep their portfolios healthy and&amp;nbsp;vibrant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a mission he relishes, and it too has some unforgettable moments. “I’ve had people invite me to a house warming and stand up in front of everyone and say ‘This is the house that Bill made possible.’ And, I get to see parents send their kids off to college without all the financial stress that often accompanies it, just because we made good decisions along the way. It doesn’t get any better than that.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill is married to Lynne, and they live in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;div&gt;
  I have been helping clients achieve their financial goals since 1983. Named as one of the Top Wealth Managers by Texas Monthly, I strive to keep that title with one client at a time.&amp;nbsp;With over 30 years of experience in client portfolio management, I&amp;nbsp;believe our nation’s ever-changing economy requires a consultant such as myself to remain current on the retirement and estate planning tax laws.
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Arts degree in finance and I currently hold the Series 7, 63, 65 and 31 licenses. I have been married for 25 years to my husband, Michael Calabro. I am active within the Dallas Community,&amp;nbsp;working on projects with&amp;nbsp;Camp Summit and Heroes.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I enjoy the Dallas Opera, traveling, and spending weekends with my family at Cedar Creek Lake.

    After graduating from 
    &lt;a href=""http://www.asu.edu/""&gt;Arizona State University’s&lt;/a&gt; College of Liberal Arts &amp;amp; Sciences in 1994, I started in the securities industry and worked my way up to becoming a Wealth Manager. Currently, I hold the Series 7, 63, and 65 securities licenses. Additionally, I have an agent license for life and health insurance in various states.
   &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;a href=""http://www.bryant.edu/""&gt;Bryant University’s&lt;/a&gt; Certificate Program in Financial Planning, and in 2012, after&amp;nbsp;fullfilling the required coursework at the College of Financial Planning, I received my 
    &lt;a href=""http://www.cfp.net/""&gt;CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™&lt;/a&gt; certificate. The multi-year CFP
    ® program entails in-depth courses, training and compreshensive examinations in all areas of financial planning including investments, taxes, insurance, estate, and retirement planning. Additionally, I am a member of the &lt;a href=""http://www.plannersearch.org/why-cfp/Pages/Why-Hire-a-Certified-Financial-Planner.aspx""&gt;Financial Planning Association&lt;/a&gt;.
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    As a Chartered Retirement Plans Specialist (CRPS®), I assist businesses, large and small, in the construction, implementation and management of their company retirement plans.&lt;br&gt;

   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;My previous firm experience includes three years at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown as an associate and six years as a financial advisor at UBS Financial Services Inc., before joining RBC Wealth Management in 2009.
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;I regularly host continuing education classes for Certified Public Accountants, and wrote a monthly financial column, titled ""Sound Advice,"" in 
    &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.capitalgazette.com/""&gt;The Capital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. 
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;div&gt;
  Currently, I live in Annapolis, Maryland, with my wife and two children, where I enjoy being active in my community and serving on the board of directors for the

     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value Statement&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I provide individual and corporate investors a broad spectrum of financial services with an emphasis on specialized portfolio management. With over 30 years of investment experience, I combine my financial knowledge with a dedication to my clients’ individual needs. By developing a close working relationship with my clients, I help create portfolios that are a true reflection of each client’s investment temperament and financial objectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;With over 30 years of experience, I have been helping clients achieve their financial goals. I specialize in creating retirement spending plans for clients entering their retirement age by using a customized approach to developing and managing their wealth. I help build financial independence and a comfortable retirement. I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1977 with a bachelor’s degree in political science. Today my professional registrations include the Series 7, 8, 63 and 65 licenses. Through an internal RBC Wealth Management program, I earned the Accredited Wealth Manager designation. The program builds on the fundamentals of wealth management with a focus on advanced knowledge and skills necessary for working with high net worth clients. I am also a member of the IAG (Investment Advisor Group) Advisory Council, whose mission is to provide strategic guidance and input on how best to grow, service, and support fee-based business.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I reside in downtown San Jose with my wife, Susan, and have two married daughters and two grandchildren. I also enjoy traveling the world with my family, and golfing. I am a CAL football fanatic and a Sharks, Giants and 49ers fan.&lt;/p&gt;

By assisting my clients with a well thought out plan, I can help them address the often complex and confusing issues surrounding investments, insurance, retirement, estate, and divorce planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently accepting new clients, and would welcome the opportunity to speak with you.

&lt;p class=""ckePara""&gt;I work to help my clients improve and organize their financial lives in a way that makes it easier for them to achieve their goals.

&lt;h4 class=""ckePara""&gt;How it Works&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class=""ckePara""&gt;The L.I.F.E.T.R.A.C. Strategy follows these 8 repeatable stages that occur throughout my clients&amp;rsquo; lifetime:&lt;/p&gt;

After completing the extensive curriculum required, Brian earned the certification of CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP®). He is licensed by the Maryland Insurance Administration and his industry licenses include the Series 7, 31, 63 and 65. Brian is also an Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF®), which represents his advanced training and competency in the subject of fiduciary responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from his notable standing within RBC Wealth Management, Brian has earned accolades and respect within the financial industry.

Brian has also been cited as an Influential Marylander by The Daily Record. From the time RBC Wealth Management acquired Ferris Baker Watts, Brian has been a member of the firm's Chairman's Council, an honor bestowed on the top 150 Financial Advisors of RBC Wealth Management Financial Advisors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian is a financial commentator on Baltimore’s WBAL news radio and television network. You can listen to him every Saturday morning at 10:00 AM on WBAL Radio hosting the ""Brian Kroneberger Financial Hour.""

     The formula Barron's uses to rank advisors is proprietary. It has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record.
