A growing body of research shows having more women on boards and in leadership positions helps companies make better decisions and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-on-corporate-boards/"" target=""_blank""&gt;increases financial performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;across various metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more women are taking their place in C-suites and boardrooms in organizations around the world, more can and must be done to achieve gender parity. There also needs to be more equality for women entrepreneurs, who only receive a small slice of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/female-founders-venture-capital-2017/"" target=""_blank""&gt;venture capital funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to affect change is to help raise awareness and celebrate individuals and organizations that are adopting innovative approaches to tackling issues of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/about-us/inclusion-and-diversity/""&gt;diversity and inclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in the boardroom, C-suite, entrepreneurship and workplaces overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology industry is doing this in part through its second annual&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/forbes-live/event/2019-boardforward-awards-west-coast/"" target=""_blank""&gt;#BoardForward Awards Gala,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;hosted by Forbes and theBoardlist. The #BoardForward Awards highlight ideas that help to break down gender bias and create a pipeline of talent for female leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event, held on March 21 at Twitter&amp;#39;s headquarters in San Francisco, brought together more than 150 leaders within the Silicon Valley community that have demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom and the C-suite. These leaders included everyone from technology executives and top founders and funders to innovators and board directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At our inaugural #BoardForward Awards Gala last year, we ignited conversations with the aim of creating the most-dynamic and inclusive workforces of the future,&amp;quot; says Moira Forbes, executive vice president of Forbes and president of ForbesWomen. &amp;ldquo;This year, with fewer women serving as CEOs of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies, there&amp;#39;s greater urgency than ever to close these pervasive gaps. When we all come together and recognize that diversity is our collective strength, we can make the systemic changes needed to ensure everyone has a voice and a seat at the table.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forbes hosted the event&amp;#39;s keynote discussion with Meg Whitman, CEO of Quibi, an accomplished executive and former California gubernatorial candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the gala, Forbes and theBoardlist presented the annual Diversity Champion Award to Whitman. The award recognizes a tech industry leader who has been a force for changing the face of their own organization and the broader ecosystem. Last year, the event celebrated the achievements of Mitchell and Freada Kapor of Kapor Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, founder and chairman of theBoardList and president of StubHub., says the event isn&amp;#39;t just a celebration of achievements, but also underscores the need for gender equality in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The future of tech IS diversity,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;The more diverse perspectives we bring to leadership and decision-making, the more we&amp;#39;ll create great products that meet our customers&amp;#39; needs, build innovative companies and create great corporate cultures.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

".ca",".ca","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Plastics and recycling: a material issue for investors","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;In 1869,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.sciencehistory.org/the-history-and-future-of-plastics"" target=""_blank""&gt;the first synthetic plastic was made&lt;/a&gt;. Its inventor was motivated by the promise of US$10,000 for the creation of a substitute for ivory. Ironically, as demand for ivory was devastating the world&amp;#39;s population of wild elephants, plastic was praised for its ability to &amp;ldquo;protect the natural world from the destructive forces of human need.&amp;quot; Plastics have since become ubiquitous in our society. But they are certainly no longer praised for their effect on the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The growing impact of plastics pollution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastic has significantly contributed to the planet&amp;#39;s environmental degradation for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the single-use nature of many plastic products&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the amount of time it takes for plastic products to break down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recycling, although beneficial, offers an imperfect solution. Despite recycling efforts, most plastics end up in landfills or in the environment. In fact, of the estimated nine billion tons of plastic that have ever been produced, only nine percent has been&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability"" target=""_blank""&gt;recycled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, awareness of this issue has garnered significant media attention, with a focus on the discarded plastics that have made their way into our oceans. The headlines are numerous and shocking, with images of the &amp;ldquo;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&amp;quot; and animals trapped in plastic rings. The numbers are equally alarming. Some scientists estimate that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean (by weight). Others claim there is currently anywhere between 150 million and 300 million tons of plastic floating in oceans, with&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;eight million additional tons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;entering the water each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the severity and scope of the issue, action on plastics pollution is being taken globally. The UN Environment Program launched the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.cleanseas.org/about"" target=""_blank""&gt;Clean Seas Campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in February 2017, with the goal of dramatically reducing marine litter,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;ocean plastics pollution was at the centre of discussions at the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://g7.gc.ca/en/g7-presidency/themes/working-together-climate-change-oceans-clean-energy/"" target=""_blank""&gt;2018 G7 Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and countless businesses and governments - at all levels - are making commitments to&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability"" target=""_blank""&gt;ban single-use plastic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, this action is in response to rising global sensitivity to plastics pollution, resulting in changing consumer preferences and regulatory pressure. In RBC Global Asset Management&amp;#39;s (RBC GAM) view, the prominence of this environmental issue has significant implications for investors. RBC GAM has now seen this discussion move into the boardrooms of investee companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investors speak out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps galvanized by public sentiment and regulatory developments, investors have been swift to take action on plastics pollution. Recently, investors have been filing prominent shareholder proposals in North America calling on companies to consider the impact of their product packaging on the environment. Proponents cite material financial, environmental, reputational and operational risks as reasons for support. They are asking the companies in which they&amp;#39;re invested to report on how they&amp;#39;re managing these risks. Indicative of public sentiment on the issue, shareholder proposals related to sustainable packaging have been receiving high levels of support &amp;ndash; well above the average level traditionally seen for&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/10/26/environmental-and-social-proposals-in-the-2017-proxy-season/"" target=""_blank""&gt;environmental and social shareholder proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The risks for business&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more companies and governments announce reduction targets related to plastics pollution, or even outright bans of plastic products, the risks associated with the use of non-sustainable packaging also increase. The UN Environment Progam&amp;#39;s 2018 report on single-use plastics found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;52 countries have some form of ban on single-use plastics at a national level&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;24 countries have a levy on single-use plastics at a national level (e.g. charging five cents for a plastic bag)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A further 18 countries have regions with some form of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability"" target=""_blank""&gt;levy or ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks, McDonald&amp;#39;s, Ikea, American Airlines, Disney and American Express are just some of the companies that have announced high-profile bans on plastic straws. A number of companies have also committed to researching and developing a more sustainable solution. And more than 40 UK companies have signed the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/what-uk-plastics-pact"" target=""_blank""&gt;UK Plastics Pact&lt;/a&gt;. This agreement is focused on three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increasing the amount of reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensuring a greater percentage of plastic packaging is effectively recycled or composted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Generally taking action to eliminate single-use packaging by 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the plastics pollution equation is the supply side. The packaging industry has been or will be subject to developing industry trends, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;shifts in consumer behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;changing cost structures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the global trend of increased environmental regulation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the rise of e-commerce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, during the U.S. holiday season, online shopping exceeded in-store purchases for the first time. It&amp;#39;s estimated that by 2020, online shopping could account for nearly 15 percent of all global retail sales, according to MSCI ESG Research LLC. Accordingly, consumer preference for online shopping could significantly increase demand for packaging. And the growth in emerging markets has led to increased consumption in those same markets and a greater need for packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative social and environmental consequences of the packaging required to meet the world&amp;#39;s increasing demand has been met with resistance from consumers who are demanding improvements in safety and environmental impacts. In addition,the packaging industry faces increasing costs. Overall, significant investments may be required for suppliers both to meet consumer demand for sustainable packaging and to improve their environmental performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Managing plastics risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastics pollution and sustainable packaging have become a material issue for investors. This is due to the forces of changing consumer preferences, environmental regulations, pressure from industry peers making headline grabbing, anti-plastic commitments, and trends pressuring the packaging industry amidst a period of global sensitivity to plastics pollution. Significant reputational, financial,regulatory and operational risks are now associated with corporate contributions to this global issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBC GAM and its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.rbcgam.com/cgri"" target=""_blank""&gt;Corporate Governance and Responsible Investment&lt;/a&gt; (CGRI) team are committed to understanding and evaluating this evolving issue. The CGRI team, formed in 2014, advances the integration of ESG principles into investment analysis by RBC GAM&amp;#39;s investment teams, collaborates with like-minded investors and engages with lawmakers or regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

".ca",".ca","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Health and wealth: Why investing in your wellness now will help you in the future","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;Health is wealth. We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen it needlepointed on a pillow in someone&amp;rsquo;s living room. Or, maybe someone has reminded us that if we &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t have our health, we don&amp;rsquo;t have anything.&amp;rdquo; Truisms that manage to both highlight and hide the complexity of the interconnections between our physical health, mental health, and financial well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Courtney Jordan Baechler, medical director of emerging science centers at the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation, says that no matter our race or gender, genomically&amp;mdash;that is, the makeup of our genes&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re 99 percent the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet women are twice as likely to develop generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, adds Dr. Jordan Baechler. Women also earn an average of 82 cents on the dollar compared to men, according to the &lt;a class=""file-pdf"" href=""https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;National Partnership for Women &amp;amp; Families&lt;/a&gt;, and 75 percent of caregivers are women, whether they&amp;rsquo;re caring for their children, parents or another family member, according to the &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.caregiver.org/caregiver-statistics-demographics"" target=""_blank""&gt;Family Caregiver Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those are objective health stats,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Jordan Baechler says. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be an award-winning scientist to know something is going on in our society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Health determines wealth, and vice versa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as 80 percent of our health is determined by what medical professionals call the 12 social determinants of health. According to &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-of-health"" target=""_blank""&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.&amp;rdquo; This includes how much money we make, which is tied to how much power we feel we have or we&amp;rsquo;re able to wield, and how much we exercise or treat ourselves right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jordan Baechler says wealth, or lack thereof, is something she regularly sees as having a profound impact on her patients&amp;rsquo; relative health. Compared to higher net worth individuals, she says, individuals with lower incomes have lower self-reported health and greater health risks for chronic conditions. And on the other end of the spectrum, she sees patients who have financial stability but are constantly working at the expense of their health. When stress levels are high, whether from worrying about money or pressure at work, our body&amp;rsquo;s primary stress hormone, cortisol, kicks in. The danger to our health, she says, comes when our stress-response system is constantly activated and we&amp;rsquo;re overexposed to that stress hormone. &amp;ldquo;We have to work hard and smart at our jobs, health, and finances,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Burning out your cortisol is a recipe for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Train for the best outcome&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angie O&amp;rsquo;Leary, head of Wealth Planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S., underscores this theory. &amp;ldquo;Health and wealth will be forever intertwined, and as you age, it becomes even more intertwined,&amp;rdquo; she says. Better health can reduce health care spending, says O&amp;rsquo;Leary, and better financial planning can reduce some of the stress that Dr. Jordan Baechler points out can lead to poor health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Women who get a financial advisor&amp;mdash;just like getting a physical trainer or dietician&amp;mdash;are likely to see better outcomes. They&amp;rsquo;ll have greater confidence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Leary stresses that a financial advisor isn&amp;rsquo;t going to say you have to give up wellness or self-care costs to save only for the future&amp;mdash;one of the pillars of good financial health is planning for your spending later &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for your spending now. In fact, a good advisor will see those costs as wise investments, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the close but oft overlooked relationship between health and wealth that prompted RBC Wealth Management to host an event on the topic geared toward women last year. The goal was to encourage women not only to link the two, but to be planful and proactive on both fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristen Kimmell, head of advisor recruiting and field marketing at RBC Wealth Management-U.S., who led the charge on creating the RBC event, compares financial planning to preventative health care, which can help prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I talk to women and ask if they have a financial advisor, many will say, &amp;lsquo;My stuff&amp;#39;s not in order,&amp;rsquo; but that&amp;rsquo;s like saying, &amp;lsquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t go to the gym until I&amp;rsquo;m in shape,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; says Kimmell.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re getting more accepting of health coaches. We need to expand coaching to financial health as well and start seeing financial health as preventive. You can prevent some pretty major mistakes in your financial success if you work with someone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Generational factors to wellness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual health, there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting link between generational health and economic wellbeing. According to a &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.bcbs.com/the-health-of-america/reports/how-millennials-current-and-future-health-could-affect-our-economy?utm_source=linked_in&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=hoa_q419&amp;amp;utm_term=national&amp;amp;utm_content=moody%27s_report_3"" target=""_blank""&gt;2019 data analysis from Blue Cross Blue Shield&lt;/a&gt;, Millennials are seeing their health decline faster than the previous generation, both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Cross Blue Shield study summarizes that &amp;ldquo;Poorer health among Millennials will keep them from contributing as much to the economy as they otherwise would.&amp;rdquo; This is where preventive care and wellness become paramount&amp;mdash;the basic pillars of good diet, exercise and sleep&amp;mdash;to turn those numbers around. And the pillars of financial health also come into play to bolster economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials aren&amp;rsquo;t the only generation with lifestyle factors to consider. Kimmell notes that Boomer women often outlive male spouses, and longer lifespans make planning for the future&amp;mdash;another financial health pillar&amp;mdash;even more integral to our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety about your economic future is damaging to mental health, Kimmell says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know if we eat a diet higher in vegetables and lower in fat, that&amp;rsquo;s preventive healthcare. We&amp;rsquo;ve learned to ask ourselves, &amp;lsquo;How do I prevent a heart attack?&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; Kimmell says. &amp;ldquo;Now we have to learn to ask, &amp;lsquo;How do I prevent a crisis of turning 50 and not having considered retirement yet?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan Baechler agrees. &amp;ldquo;[Women] put ourselves last all the time. [Women] tend to prioritize everything besides our own health. We say, &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this, I&amp;rsquo;m too busy&amp;rsquo; but we&amp;rsquo;re leaving smart dollars, investments, and future stability on the table. How do we make it easier to help people feel good and accomplish all areas&amp;mdash;career, health, and investment&amp;mdash;because they&amp;rsquo;re so interconnected?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

".ca",".ca","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Collaborative philanthropy: How the next generation is teaming up to create lasting change","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;A new generation of passionate changemakers are hoping to take collaborative philanthropy to the next level in an increasingly interconnected world to solve some of the planet&amp;#39;s most pressing issues. With more like-minded philanthropists, more resources and a burgeoning number of charitable collaborations, this new generation of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) is not content with simply putting money toward causes they believe in&amp;mdash;they want to make sure their efforts have enduring impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re a generation influenced by&amp;nbsp;globalization, who worry about the kind of world their children will grow up in. As a result, they&amp;#39;re more often socially and environmentally conscious: 93 percent of them donate to philanthropic causes, according to new research from RBC, along with Campden Wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &amp;ldquo;want their children to learn values of not only hard work and an understanding of the value of money, but also tolerance and respect for others, along with a sense of social and environmental responsibility,&amp;rdquo; the report says, adding that more than half of those surveyed believe these are important lessons to learn at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Shaping tomorrow, today&amp;nbsp;report surveyed over 100 next-generation wealth holders from Canada, the United States and the UK. The report found that in the last 12 months alone, 84 percent gave as much as US$1 million of their personal wealth to charitable causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But top of mind for more than a third of respondents is making sure their money is put to good use and measuring its impact. Nearly a quarter say one of the biggest challenges of giving is identifying the right organizations to support, while 11 and 10 percent say the greatest challenge is finding co-investing partners and scaling up, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Teaming up to have a greater impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philanthropy done well is always collaborative to some degree, says Valerie Chort, vice president of Corporate Citizenship at RBC and executive director of RBC Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, it&amp;#39;s about making an impact around a common cause&amp;mdash;often addressing a systemic challenge&amp;mdash;as a group, typically pairing investors with nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Fell, who heads global ultra-high-net-worth services at RBC, says philanthropists involved in this kind of work recognize they can do better and do more by working with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s arguably more mature philanthropy, more sophisticated,&amp;rdquo; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s a significant sign of experience, maturity&amp;mdash;just a little bit more sophistication. There&amp;#39;s less ego involved,&amp;rdquo; says Fell, who is also the board chair for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.princestrust.ca/about-us/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Prince&amp;#39;s Trust Canada&lt;/a&gt;, part of a global charity established by the Prince of Wales that focuses on empowering youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the most ordinary person, it&amp;#39;s recognition that by giving together, one and one can make three.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBC Foundation&amp;#39;s Chort says it&amp;#39;s not necessarily just about how much money one puts towards a cause, but what they can bring to the table in other ways too. This is something the next generation of UHNW philanthropists recognize, according to the RBC report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Generation X from the U.S. explained in an interview for the report, &amp;ldquo;The previous generation really saw investments as investments, and charity as writing a cheque. So I&amp;#39;m in the process of thinking more about how to use our financial background to leverage our giving, versus just one extreme (philanthropy) or the other (investing).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, experienced philanthropists understand that even a billion-dollar investment in a charitable cause can be multiplied when they team up with others. Partnering with governments, the private sector, as well as other non-governmental organizations, for example, can bring scale, reputational growth and many other advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://givingpledge.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;The Giving Pledge&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2010, has served as a strong road map for UHNW families when collaborating with others on large scale, high-impact philanthropy. As of May 2019, the pledge had 204 signatories from 22 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trying to tackle some of the world&amp;#39;s most challenging problems, which have been magnified by the COVID crisis, becomes much more complex and challenging than one single philanthropist can do on their own,&amp;rdquo; says Robyn Calder, executive director of The ELMA Philanthropies and a member of the RBC Philanthropy Advisory Council. It&amp;#39;s even more critical now, she says, to engage with others to create social change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The key to successful collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it&amp;#39;s not enough to simply pool money with others. &amp;ldquo;You need to embark around a passion that ignites you as a person,&amp;rdquo; Fell says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just over half of those surveyed say they support education and academic research. This is followed by youth and children (34 percent) and almost a third believe in helping fund arts, culture and sports, as well as community development. Nearly a quarter of those surveyed support health initiatives and just over one-fifth support environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, animal rights and food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that passion is identified, it&amp;#39;s also important to understand the initiative and its mission in order to ensure there&amp;#39;s strong, effective governance associated with it. Due diligence is also required to ensure everyone is aligned and shares the same values around the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions to ask include: how much do they know about the issue? Are they well-versed or are they just getting started? What can they bring to the cause? Is it money or entrepreneurial experience? How well do you know the ecosystem for the issue you want to support? How is&amp;nbsp;impact measured and tracked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In order to have collaborative philanthropy ... you want to bring the best partners together to be able to solve that issue together,&amp;rdquo; says Chort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a group wants to find solutions to homelessness, for example, they need to engage policy makers, people who deal with homelessness on the streets, experts in real estate &amp;mdash;different parts of the ecosystem, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s bringing together individuals who care about the same issue, pooling their money and expertise to achieve something greater than themselves, Chort explains, but she cautions: &amp;ldquo;Understanding the power dynamics is really important, so you can actually achieve collaboration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Chort says funders bringing in the money need to understand their role so they don&amp;#39;t inadvertently impose a direction or a view that may not necessarily be the best approach for a given situation&amp;mdash;that&amp;#39;s not collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What does collaborative philanthropy look like today?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://skoll.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;The Skoll Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Canadian billionaire Jeffrey Skoll, invests in individuals or groups whose goals are to try and solve some of the world&amp;#39;s most pressing social, cultural and environmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ambitious funds include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.bluemeridian.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Blue Meridian Partners&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on strategies that can make the greatest difference in lifting families and young people out of poverty in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.co-impact.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Co-Impact&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes itself as a global philanthropic collaborative that brings together local communities, nonprofits, governments, donors and many others to solve social problems on a large scale. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://end.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;END Fund&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;collaborates with governments, NGOs, drug companies, academic partners and others to tackle neglected tropical diseases that affect more than 1.7 billion people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/"" target=""_blank""&gt;the Great Reset&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in direct response to COVID-19 and the political, economic and social upheaval it&amp;#39;s caused. Fell says the pandemic has brought inequities to the forefront and a heightened sense of urgency for many philanthropists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Especially as a result of the pandemic, there&amp;#39;s certainly an emergence of people who want to partner with others to address change,&amp;rdquo; Fell says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;#39;s much more to come here and we&amp;#39;re just at the forefront of seeing a surge in thinking around collaborative philanthropy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Governments are shifting energy policies back in favor of fossil fuels in the short term, raising fears the energy transition may end up on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the new focus on energy security doesn&amp;rsquo;t irrevocably threaten the climate change mitigation agenda, in our view. Rather, the green energy transition, while slowing in the near term in some aspects, is very likely to accelerate in others, particularly in Europe. We explore the investment opportunities arising from the friction between security and climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Perilous dependency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;rsquo;s war on Ukraine has made energy security a pressing priority. It is not only the moral issue of replacing a rogue supplier that is using energy profits to finance an unprovoked war. Governments around the world also wish to shelter their citizens and economies from harmful spikes in global energy prices. The Russian invasion has exacerbated an existing uptrend in energy prices, with oil and gas prices leaping as much as 30 percent and 150 percent, respectively, before retreating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Exposure to Russian energy&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Europe is most exposed to Russian energy&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p class=""disclaimer""&gt;Source - International Energy Agency, U.S. Energy Information Administration, GOV.UK, Eurostat, Canada.ca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries are refocusing their energy policies, particularly&amp;mdash;but not exclusively&amp;mdash;those with a heavy reliance on Russian oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shortly after the invasion, the EU issued its new energy plan, REPowerEU, a roadmap to reduce Russian natural gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and to cut off Russian fuels completely by the end of the decade. Much of the implementation of this plan is left to the bloc&amp;rsquo;s member states. Most are looking for alternative suppliers of gas and to extend the life of coal-fired power plants to fill the gap in the short term. At the same time, the push for renewable energy is being jump-started.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The UK, having banned Russian energy imports entirely, issued its new British Energy Security Strategy in April. The plan focuses on more drilling for oil and gas in the short term, but it also calls for offshore wind and nuclear power to make up the shortfall over the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even countries that don&amp;rsquo;t rely much on Russian energy are reevaluating their energy strategies, looking for ways to boost energy output in an effort to alleviate elevated energy prices and to help countries scrambling to replace Russian energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The U.S. has reshaped climate and energy discussions since the Russian invasion due to crippling energy prices. Fossil fuels are no longer seen in as bad a light, and recognized as having an important role to play in mitigating the energy crisis. President Joe Biden, who recently signed a deal for the U.S. to supply Europe with liquefied natural gas (LNG) until at least 2030, has called for more fracking, and has gone as far as considering imposing fines on companies that do not use their federal leases to drill for oil. Still, no long-term changes to the U.S.&amp;rsquo;s energy policies have been announced, though key climate provisions within Biden&amp;rsquo;s Build Back Better legislation have stalled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unrelated to the invasion, the Canadian government issued a 271-page document at the end of March calling for a 42 percent reduction in the country&amp;rsquo;s oil and gas emissions from 2019 levels by the end of the decade as part of its 2030 emissions reduction goal. The document reiterates Canada&amp;rsquo;s commitments to climate change mitigation and the energy transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Going against the grain?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sense of urgency and in an effort to find a short-term fix, several strategies to increase energy supplies are being touted, including more drilling, diversifying LNG suppliers, and expanding the life of existing coal power plants. All would slow progress toward achieving net-zero emissions in the short term and seem like a step back in the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;More drilling&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization of the importance of energy security and the reaction to elevated energy prices have both led to calls to increase drilling in key oil-producing countries, such as the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, oil- and gas-rich Norway and the UK are also considering increasing domestic production. RBC Capital Markets sees potential for a significant jump in the UK&amp;rsquo;s North Sea activity in 2022, following a steady decline in capital expenditure since 2013. Many projects previously deemed uneconomical are becoming attractive in today&amp;rsquo;s elevated price environment. The emphasis is likely to be on gas developments given European gas prices are likely to stay firm over the coming years and Europe remains a significant importer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if the additional drilling comes at the expense of LNG imports, it could actually lower carbon emissions. In its recent report &amp;ldquo;The European Energy Trilemma&amp;rdquo; RBC Capital Markets calculated that LNG imports are at least three times more carbon-intensive than domestic gas production. Moreover, supporting domestic energy supplies is typically a cheaper alternative to imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, additional drilling does not necessarily mean unbridled drilling. The Canadian government&amp;rsquo;s recent approval of a $12 billion offshore oil project off the coast of Newfoundland sets out 137 legally binding conditions, including the requirement the project reaches net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada also released an energy plan in March 2022 that suggests rolling out a tax credit for carbon capture and storage, a process that can reduce 50 percent to 70 percent of carbon emissions from industrial processes. We would expect broad deployment of this tool to moderate carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are mitigating circumstances and additional drilling may not be as much a setback to climate goals as initially feared, the risk is that the world could remain locked into fuel dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Diversifying the LNG supplier base&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace Russian energy in the short term, many in Europe are focusing on diversifying natural gas supplies before the next winter. The second-round effect of this strategy may be to unintentionally increase carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the U.S. has upped its LNG shipments to the region and Canada has pledged to increase exports to Europe. Meanwhile, Germany has reached out to Qatar, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest exporter of natural gas with 15 percent of global exports, about obtaining more supply to meet its gas needs. Italy is also ramping up gas imports via its recently completed deal with Algeria, its second-largest supplier after Russia, for alternative supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether LNG is received from one supplier or another may not by itself increase carbon emissions. But the RBC Capital Markets report noted that a diversification of European LNG imports would likely mean that shipments are diverted away from Asian countries&amp;mdash;perhaps leaving them with little alternative than to burn more coal to meet their energy needs. Coal is a cheap but much more polluting alternative to natural gas, producing 50 percent more emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, merely tapping other sources of LNG supplies may have unwelcome knock-on effects for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Expanding the life of coal-fired plants&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of countries, including the UK and Germany, are considering expanding the life of coal-fired power plants previously designated for closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg estimates that burning additional coal instead of Russian gas would increase the EU&amp;rsquo;s carbon emissions by about eight percent. But it points out that as Europe isn&amp;rsquo;t planning to construct new coal power plants as part of its response to the crisis, any pollution created by new coal and oil imports could be offset by the scaling up of green energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Nuclear: The comeback kid?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortunes of nuclear power may be about to improve as some governments are attracted by its emissions-free attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 15 years to 2020, nuclear energy&amp;rsquo;s share of global electricity production fell from 17.5 percent to just over 10 percent. Nuclear accidents and leaks are one reason. Nuclear energy is not only slow to build and more expensive to produce but costs have also been going up, unlike most other energy sources. Then there is the thorny issue of how to dispose of nuclear waste. Finally, the materials used, from the steel that is manufactured to construct the power plant to uranium ore, aren&amp;rsquo;t renewable though nuclear energy itself is emissions-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision to label nuclear energy a &amp;ldquo;sustainable investment&amp;rdquo; earlier this year was controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite nuclear energy&amp;rsquo;s drawbacks, several governments and corporations are considering nuclear expansion. Recently, the UK, suffering from gas shortages and prone to a dearth of wind, announced it is looking at expanding the share of this energy source. France, which derives more than 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, more than any other country, announced the &amp;ldquo;renaissance&amp;rdquo; of the French nuclear industry, and plans to construct up to 14 new nuclear reactors by 2050. Both countries are also considering extending the life of existing nuclear plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation nuclear reactors known as small modular reactors may hold some promise as they are cheaper and quicker to build. Four Canadian provinces have announced plans for the new breed of small reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Poland, where 70 percent of electricity production burns coal, energy-intensive companies are spearheading the drive for greater use of nuclear energy. They are eager to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the &lt;a href=""https://read.rbcwm.com/31t7Z2d"" title=""Putting a price on carbon emissions""&gt;cost of which has increased relentlessly&lt;/a&gt; over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that energy security means a diversified portfolio of energy, nuclear does have a role to play in the energy transition, given that many renewable energy sources are intermittent. China is planning at least 150 new reactors in the next 15 years, or more than the world has built in the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Cost of electricity by source&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Electricity from renewables became cheaper as capacity increased; electricity from nuclear and coal did not&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Redoubling green energy efforts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond harnessing fossil fuel energy in the short term, and making difficult and at times controversial decisions to rethink their plans for nuclear energy, many governments are redoubling efforts toward energy efficiency at the same time. Developing a low-carbon economy could be a very effective energy security strategy. This is an opportunity in Europe, and it also may be so in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Ramping up wind and solar energy&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ember, an energy think tank, 50 countries around the world, including the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, and the UK, generate at least 10 percent of their energy needs from wind and solar. Denmark remains the leader, generating more than 50 percent of its energy from these sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewables&amp;rsquo; contribution is likely to grow further. RBC Capital Markets points out that the pace of renewable energy development in Europe has become increasingly important in recent months as the urgency for a shift from natural gas picks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the REPowerEU plan, investments to reduce emissions by 55 percent by 2030 relative to 1990 levels will be frontloaded, increasing the average deployment rate by 20 percent. Another 80 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity has also been targeted by 2030 to enable the production of more renewable hydrogen. Germany has brought forward its target of reaching 100 percent clean energy by 2035, or 15 years earlier than initially planned. Many countries lacking large deposits of fossil fuels will look to do the same as wind and solar are, after all, omnipresent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should help to ensure that the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s target of 40 percent renewable energy sources in the EU&amp;rsquo;s overall energy mix by 2030, twice the 2020 level, is reached earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, one of the main objectives of the new British Energy Security Strategy focuses on offshore wind. The government has increased its target for offshore wind generation to 50 GW by 2030, up from 40 GW, with a new target of 5 GW coming from floating turbines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing hurdles such as streamlining the lengthy and stringent planning permission requirements for renewable projects could arguably prove even more important than the increase in the rollout targets. The EU is set to publish a recommendation on fast-tracking the permitting of renewable energy projects in May. The UK government has likewise promised to implement reforms to cut approval times in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind and solar technologies are not magic wands, of course, as these will also need more infrastructure, including transmission lines, batteries, and charging stations for electric vehicles. Much of this will require mining projects in metals critical to building a green economy, such as aluminum, cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, silver, and zinc. Such mining will likely damage local environments and is often located in countries with high political risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Hydrogen revolution brought forward&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High gas prices are also changing the cost equation for hydrogen. Previously, &amp;ldquo;green hydrogen,&amp;rdquo; or hydrogen produced by electrolyser machines powered by solar and wind power, had long been considered too expensive to produce, costing up to four times as much as the cheaper, fossil fuel-derived &amp;ldquo;grey hydrogen.&amp;rdquo; It was thought that &amp;ldquo;blue hydrogen,&amp;rdquo; which uses carbon capture to remove the bulk of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted during production processes, would be the type of hydrogen most likely used in the short term to help achieve the green energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given the increase in the price of natural gas, the premium cost of green hydrogen has markedly declined. BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy, recently calculated that green hydrogen could be cost-effective today&amp;mdash;cost parity had previously not been expected until the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduced cost differential is happening at an opportune time. In late 2021, the EU launched a &amp;euro;2 billion partnership with industry to accelerate research and development in green hydrogen, which involved scaling up green hydrogen electrolysers from a megawatt to gigawatt scale to bring down the cost of the technology even further. The reduced price premium on green hydrogen makes the EU&amp;rsquo;s target for hydrogen to supply at least 10 percent of the bloc&amp;rsquo;s energy needs by 2050 appear more achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensing the opportunity, H2 Mobility Deutschland, a private German company, recently raised $120 million to more than triple the number of its hydrogen refueling stations by the end of the decade to 300. The aim is for these facilities to meet the demand for heavy-duty and long-haul transportation in Europe. The goal is to expand the hydrogen network along several popular transportation corridors and in cooperation with public authorities and fleet operators to ensure offtake for the stations, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the hydrogen industry, which until recently was struggling much like the wind farm industry had a decade ago before costs dropped and installations proliferated, is likely to enjoy stronger growth going forward, in our view, just as its wind energy predecessor did when the cost equation tilted in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Energy efficiency in focus&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With much effort being made toward increasing energy supply, the demand side should not be forgotten, and we expect energy efficiency will be increasingly in focus going forward. Measures such as switching to heat pumps and better-insulated houses also can reduce energy demand and hence the dependence on natural gas. While the British Energy Security Strategy disappointed many by omitting these measures, the recent budget announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak abolished the sales tax on energy efficiency measures such as home insulation and solar panels. Canada&amp;rsquo;s new energy roadmap includes an additional CA$500 million for the existing greener homes program, which helps cover the costs of similar energy-saving improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Portfolio implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imperatives of energy transition and energy security need not compete with each other. Developing a low-carbon economy could be a very effective energy security strategy. The current crisis may ultimately reveal itself as an opportunity, much like the energy crisis of the 1970s did, to foster energy innovation in a variety of areas including low-carbon technologies such as green hydrogen, nuclear, as well as carbon capture and storage, and the promising but still expensive direct air capture. On the demand side, much more can be done to reduce demand via energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the energy transition has become more complex and multifaceted, the energy security imperative has given it more impetus in certain areas. We continue to see many opportunities in the SusTech theme, particularly in &lt;a href=""https://read.rbcwm.com/3e8Q3hb"" title=""What will it take to transform to a clean energy world?""&gt;GreenTech&lt;/a&gt; as many of the drivers of energy security are critical to fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Industries likely to benefit from energy security&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The pursuit of energy security could benefit a wide range of industries&lt;/h6&gt;
