&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is an &amp;ldquo;umbrella&amp;rdquo; concept, covering a wide range of disciplines and technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive computing, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; aspect of AI is at the root of what the technology can do&amp;mdash;intelligence is the capacity to connect comprehension with logic, which results in the ability to draw conclusions from previous experiences. Humans process information like this day in and day out, without even thinking about it. As such, AI can be interpreted as a set of algorithms (logic), programs (instructions to a computer), and statistical models that interact to replicate an output very similar to that of human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, AI is unable to connect insights or understand specifically &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; something is happening&amp;mdash;another key aspect of human thinking. A book published by New Scientist on the topic states that &amp;ldquo;AI can&amp;rsquo;t strip us of our jobs, our dignity or our human rights. Only other humans can do that.&amp;rdquo; This suggests that humans are ultimately responsible for their future. In other words, at this stage it&amp;rsquo;s humans who control AI, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Revival of AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AI might seem like a very 21st century concept, it is not new. The term was coined in 1956 and AI went through alternating phases of early development followed by hibernation. During the 1970s and later in the 1990s, research progress completely stalled for nearly two decades&amp;mdash;what became dubbed the &amp;ldquo;AI winters&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;due to unfulfilled promises and lack of funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its revival has been driven by a simultaneous improvement of factors never seen before: the availability of immensely large volumes of data (big data), the advancement of machine learning algorithms, cheap data storage, and increased computing capacity via graphics processing units (GPUs) that meaningfully reduce computation time. AI would not be fully viable without any one of these improvements. For example, consider the dramatic decline in storage costs that enables AI users to store previously unimagined quantities of data, so much data that it is doubling in size every two years. In 1980 one gigabyte of storage cost $437,000; by 2016 the cost had plunged to just under $0.02.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Human + Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we can loosely define AI, there is no uniform definition that everyone agrees on. A philosopher would look at it from an existential point of view, but a computer scientist would evaluate a machine&amp;rsquo;s ability to perform tasks requiring human intelligence and an economist might look at AI&amp;rsquo;s impact on GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, most references to AI revolve around three main stages of development: Artificial Narrow Intelligence, Artificial General Intelligence, and Artificial Super Intelligence (defined in the table below). However, it is crucial to recognize that only one, Artificial Narrow Intelligence, is mature today, while the hype about AI taking over the world refers to the other two areas in nascent stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some see the potential for significant leaps in AI, especially related to the human brain. Futurist and Google&amp;rsquo;s Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil suggests that for the last 4,000 years the human brain has been &amp;ldquo;limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure&amp;rdquo; and AI has the ability to &amp;ldquo;expand our neocortex&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the part of the brain responsible for higher functions&amp;mdash;in quantity and quality. During a TED Talk he said that &amp;ldquo;if you need some extra neocortex, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to connect to it on the cloud directly from your brain. That additional quantity will again be an enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Three main stages of AI development&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=""table-responsive""&gt;

		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Artificial General Intelligence&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Not restricted to one field; it includes problem-solving, reasoning, and cognition. It understands why something is happening and draws on many experiences and conceptualizing models to develop actual scenarios (e.g., action plans, projections, etc.).&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Not mature&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Artificial Super Intelligence&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Covers all fields and surpasses human intelligence in many aspects.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Pre-embryonic&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prospect might be exciting to some and dreadful to others. While it&amp;rsquo;s intriguing to contemplate future scenarios, it is yet to be seen to what extent far-reaching projections such as these will materialize. Even without massive leaps, today the opportunities for AI are vast and we believe it is evident that human expertise has the potential to be augmented by a combination of human and machine intelligence, which surpasses that of either a human or a machine on a standalone basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;AI transformation journey has just begun&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is already beginning to make its mark in a wide variety of industries. For the first time in its decades-long history it has become commercialized. Internet giants use it for search optimization and product recommendation, among other applications, while businesses outside of the technology industry have begun to implement AI for uses such as fraud detection, facial recognition, mapping the customer journey, and much more. It has even made some headway in art and media&amp;mdash;a painting created by AI recently sold at a Christie&amp;rsquo;s auction for $432,500 and the world&amp;rsquo;s first AI news anchor has gone live in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the global market for AI is estimated to be approximately $7.3B and is forecast to reach some $90B by 2025, based on Statista data. North America is expected to be the biggest consumer in the market with its widening usage of AI applications across numerous business verticals, while Asia Pacific will likely experience the fastest growth in uptake of the new technology, according to Reuters. AI is rapidly emerging as an industry in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Impact of AI on major sectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because AI&amp;rsquo;s commercialization and presence in public equity markets are relatively new, so far AI offers limited opportunities for pure-play investment. The direct beneficiaries are confined to areas like software, where some companies have established a first-mover advantage. As time passes, as happened with previous technological breakthroughs (e.g., the internet), the massive number of private AI startups likely will be reduced to only a comparatively few winners, in our view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach would be to invest in indirect beneficiaries, companies that would benefit from incorporating AI technologies in their business. In addition to technology and communication services, we expect five industries to benefit in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Health care&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New AI innovations in the health care industry are appearing with great rapidity, making it the most promising industry, in our view, where image recognition has dramatically improved diagnostics&amp;mdash;detecting melanoma skin cancer with 95 percent accuracy, for example&amp;mdash;adding decision-making support and improved patient monitoring. Big data combined with AI is opening up the possibilities of customized, individual therapies replacing the &amp;ldquo;one-size-fits-all&amp;rdquo; protocols that have characterized cancer treatment for decades. Heart disease diagnosis and treatment could benefit in the same way. Deep learning and predictive analytics tools are reducing the costs and time of drug development by predicting the therapeutic use of new drugs, thus driving significant efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Transportation&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry practitioners expect autonomous vehicles to transform the future of transport along with other AI solutions that will: predict traffic flow and analyze pedestrian patterns to reduce accidents, speed traffic flow and the efficient movement of goods, reduce congestion, air pollution, and energy consumption; not to mention free up valuable land and physical assets currently dedicated to housing and storing autos that are often in use for less than an hour each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI supports production forecasting and quality control with robotics and sensor technologies. In its 10-year strategic plan, &amp;ldquo;Made in China 2025,&amp;rdquo; China is revamping its industrial base, and the International Federation of Robotics expects China to account for 40 percent of the total worldwide sales of robots by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Retail&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI&amp;rsquo;s applications in e-commerce include product discovery tools such as visual search, 3D virtual reality, customized product recommendations, targeted marketing, and potentially delivery through AI-powered drones or other self-driving vehicles. Importantly, AI&amp;rsquo;s predictive analytics could provide, and in some cases already are, the rapid just-in-time inventory management that would permit brick-and-mortar retailers the capacity to compete more effectively against the online threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Financials&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is making strides in the form of virtual assistants, chatbots, speech recognition, alternative data sources, sophisticated trading models, real-time risk assessment, the development of innovative new financial instruments, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investments ex machina&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe AI offers transformative opportunities for society, governments, and businesses, even though the state of the technology still lags the hype. Like other periods of rapid industrial/technological change, we expect AI&amp;rsquo;s emergence will create a substantial increase in global wealth in the coming decades. However, it is unlikely that increased wealth will be delivered equitably or &amp;ldquo;fairly.&amp;rdquo; There will undoubtedly be large dislocations that produce both winners and losers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear to us is that AI is here to stay. As with the arrival of computers, automation, and the internet, those companies that pursue the opportunities AI presents and understand the competitive threats it may pose, will likely fare better than those who choose to ignore it or fight a rearguard action to forestall it. We believe factoring its impact into investment decisions and choices will rapidly become a &amp;ldquo;must have&amp;rdquo; rather than a &amp;ldquo;nice to have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Witness Houston, Texas, which endured three massively damaging floods over the span of 2015, 2016, and 2017, each of which was rated a 1-in-500-year event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, 415 asset managers, together overseeing assets totaling $32T, signed an open letter to governments urging more action on climate change, which they say threatens their holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum (WEF), in its &lt;a href=""https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2019"" target=""_blank""&gt;Global Risks Report 2019&lt;/a&gt;, noted that climate change, already a major concern in 2018, had moved up a notch in its ranking of the most pressing risks. A survey of the WEF&amp;rsquo;s stakeholder-respondents, made up of insurance and reinsurance companies, banks, and industry-based focus groups, revealed the top three global risks are related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Top five risks identified in the World Economic Forum&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Global Risks Report 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p class=""disclaimer""&gt;Source - World Economic Forum&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Global Risks Report 2018 &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How can climate change affect businesses?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects of climate change impact countries and sectors unevenly. &lt;a href=""https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/global/en/p/eric-lascelles-2/detail/?p=e""&gt;Eric Lascelles&lt;/a&gt;, RBC Global Asset Management&amp;rsquo;s chief economist, points to research arguing that, logically, warmer countries will likely be affected most negatively, while some colder countries might not be negatively affected to the same degree. Asia is seen as most vulnerable, particularly China with close to 150 million people living in coastal areas threatened by rising sea levels as polar ice caps are melting faster than previously forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet investors living in the Northern Hemisphere should not be complacent. Climate change can lead to increased costs for businesses, some tangible and visible, some less so, but costly nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, extreme heat can not only reduce crop yields, increasing the cost of raw materials for food companies and households, it can also cause huge spikes in power prices, increasing energy costs. It can also affect labour productivity across a wide swath of industries, from agriculture to call centers to construction. Crippling heat and humidity may threaten equipment in data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising sea levels can disturb offshore oil and gas infrastructure and can cause flooding, disrupting increasingly integrated global just-in-time supply chains. Warmer water can impact aquaculture as well as power stations which use water to cool reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Droughts can be devastating too. In the second half of 2018, the water levels of Germany&amp;rsquo;s Rhine River, a key transport corridor for moving industrial products, declined to a 12-year low, so barges could not be fully loaded. BASF, a German chemicals manufacturer and only one of the companies affected, stated that it incurred some $250M worth of additional costs to use other, more expensive modes of transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Policymakers are also preoccupied&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just businesses that are preoccupied. Central bankers are also studying how monetary policy could be impacted. Extreme weather events can affect growth and push inflation higher, impeding policymakers&amp;rsquo; ability to decipher underlying economic trends. In the example above, lower water levels in the Rhine contributed to lower economic growth while at the same time driving up inflation due to resulting fuel shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., repeatedly weak Q1 GDP data over a number of years has in part been explained by weather factors, but what if these mask a real slowing trend? Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has gone as far as suggesting that the potential impact of climate change be included in bank stress tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long run, according to Lascelles, climate change could result in a loss of economic output through an unpalatable mix of less favourable climate conditions for economic activity, and the cost of adjusting to an altered climate, including insurance costs or liability risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises, the debate continues about what costs higher worldwide temperatures will impose on the global economy. Lascelles refers to work by American Nobel Prize-winning economist William Nordhaus which estimates that those costs will rise exponentially. A temperature rise of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will cost the global economy one percent of lost output by the end of the century. But double the temperature increase to four degrees and the cost quadruples to a much more painful four percent of lost global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Long-term economic effects of climate change&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=""climate change investment chart 2"" src=""/documents/10192/0/climate-change-investment-chart-2-in-page.png/e79855ed-8c7c-45eb-826c-c8ffe8e0c979?t=1555627684040"" style=""width: 100%;"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""arial footnote""&gt;The damage from climate change will be non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""disclaimer no-marg-bottom""&gt;Note: Change in temperature relative to pre-industrial levels defined as the period from 1850 to 1900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""disclaimer""&gt;Source: &lt;em&gt;IPCC Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report&lt;/em&gt;; W.D. Nordhaus and A. Moffat (2017) &amp;ldquo;A Survey of Global Impacts of Climate Change: Replication, Survey Methods, and a Statistical Analysis&amp;rdquo;; RBC Global Asset Management&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage would be gradual but insidious, Lascelles says, with the global economy only growing by a few hundredths of a percentage point slower per year. Spread over many decades, this would certainly add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;All very hush hush&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few companies talk about the potential impact of climate change on their infrastructure or actively manage climate risk for fear of exposing a potential weakness or liability. For CEOs focused on delivering the next set of quarterly results, so many other factors may seem more urgent, tangible, predictable, or even easier to prepare for, such as fending off the consequences of wage growth or more intense competition. According to S&amp;amp;P Global, only some 15 percent of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 disclose effects on earnings from weather-related events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many corporate management teams worry that preparing for climate change may put a company at a competitive disadvantage. The significant negative effect on cash flows and margins for a company which is building slack and/or redundancies into its supply chain to offset the impact of potential floods could damage its competitiveness if rivals don&amp;rsquo;t follow suit or don&amp;rsquo;t have to because they are located in regions that don&amp;rsquo;t face the same climatic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;This could hurt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the reluctance of companies to publicly acknowledge the challenge, we believe investors can and should take climate change into consideration as it may impact investment returns. Mercer, a consulting firm for institutional investors, opines that the performance of agriculture, timberland, real estate, and emerging market equities would be most affected in a worst-case scenario of a four-degree increase in temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed investors could start shunning companies perceived to be negatively exposed to climate change for fear liabilities will eventually materialise. PG&amp;amp;E, a U.S. utility, offers an extreme example. The enormous legal liabilities stemming from PG&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s possible role in sparking California&amp;rsquo;s massive 2018 wildfires, which fed on an increasingly parched landscape, far exceeded the company&amp;rsquo;s insurance coverage. With its debt downgraded by rating agencies, credit became unavailable, and PG&amp;amp;E, targeted by short sellers, had to file for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lascelles points out investors may start to actively sell companies and regions of the world that may be hurt the most by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESG&amp;nbsp;funds (which factor in environmental, social, and governance criteria) now make up a substantial and growing 26 percent of all professionally managed assets in the U.S. as of the start of 2018, according to the US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. The managers of these funds will decline to own companies that do not stand up to their scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies may even see their cost of borrowing increase. Credit rating agencies have started to include climate risk considerations into their assessments. S&amp;amp;P Global altered over 100 corporate ratings in 2017, or twice as many as in the previous two years, pointing to environmental and climate considerations. Fitch and Moody&amp;rsquo;s are following suit. In time, funding costs will rise for companies vulnerable to climate change, with potentially serious consequences for profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Not all bad news&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors wishing to focus on companies best placed to deal with the challenges of climate change could focus on ESG funds whose managers scrutinize their holdings so as to minimize these risks. In addition, climate change can also unearth opportunities for new industries and innovative companies to develop products and strategies to address or mitigate the environmental damage of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy and electric vehicles are top of mind these days, but there is a whole range of other industries and spaces which stand to benefit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Construction of sea walls and levees to protect against storm surges and flooding on coasts as well as flood-prone inland regions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Special building material manufacturers as roofing and insulation products evolve to meet changing residential and commercial building codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Indoor agriculture and aquaculture to control air and water temperatures and shield against acid rain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Housing required for disaster response or to accommodate human migration that could be sparked by climate change; the U.N. expects some 200 million climate refugees by 2050&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Land and real estate located far from oceans, flood plains, and areas with fresh water shortages&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Desalination plants in drought-prone regions or systems which keep water clean after purifying it; pumps, filters, and other technologies used in water storage/transmission and for wastewater management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providers of energy efficiency systems for new commercial, industrial, and large multifamily residential structures; companies that retrofit older buildings to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and power consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Change in the air&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, climate change is creating a climate of change for businesses and investors. Companies will increasingly need to think about how climate change affects the way they do business. We are already seeing central bank policymakers as well as rating agencies considering the potential impact. Investors too should be proactive and think about how to adapt their portfolios to the climate change challenge &amp;hellip; and opportunity. The returns of investments in companies and regions most exposed to climate change may be hurt. We would be on the lookout for companies which address, monitor, or help avoid environmental damage and those which successfully prepare for climate change, as they are likely to find favour with investors.&lt;/p&gt;

A growing body of research shows having more women on boards and in leadership positions helps companies make better decisions and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-on-corporate-boards/"" target=""_blank""&gt;increases financial performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;across various metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more women are taking their place in C-suites and boardrooms in organizations around the world, more can and must be done to achieve gender parity. There also needs to be more equality for women entrepreneurs, who only receive a small slice of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/female-founders-venture-capital-2017/"" target=""_blank""&gt;venture capital funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to affect change is to help raise awareness and celebrate individuals and organizations that are adopting innovative approaches to tackling issues of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/about-us/inclusion-and-diversity/""&gt;diversity and inclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in the boardroom, C-suite, entrepreneurship and workplaces overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology industry is doing this in part through its second annual&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/forbes-live/event/2019-boardforward-awards-west-coast/"" target=""_blank""&gt;#BoardForward Awards Gala,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;hosted by Forbes and theBoardlist. The #BoardForward Awards highlight ideas that help to break down gender bias and create a pipeline of talent for female leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event, held on March 21 at Twitter&amp;#39;s headquarters in San Francisco, brought together more than 150 leaders within the Silicon Valley community that have demonstrated a commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom and the C-suite. These leaders included everyone from technology executives and top founders and funders to innovators and board directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At our inaugural #BoardForward Awards Gala last year, we ignited conversations with the aim of creating the most-dynamic and inclusive workforces of the future,&amp;quot; says Moira Forbes, executive vice president of Forbes and president of ForbesWomen. &amp;ldquo;This year, with fewer women serving as CEOs of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies, there&amp;#39;s greater urgency than ever to close these pervasive gaps. When we all come together and recognize that diversity is our collective strength, we can make the systemic changes needed to ensure everyone has a voice and a seat at the table.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forbes hosted the event&amp;#39;s keynote discussion with Meg Whitman, CEO of Quibi, an accomplished executive and former California gubernatorial candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the gala, Forbes and theBoardlist presented the annual Diversity Champion Award to Whitman. The award recognizes a tech industry leader who has been a force for changing the face of their own organization and the broader ecosystem. Last year, the event celebrated the achievements of Mitchell and Freada Kapor of Kapor Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

The responsibility for accumulating a retirement nest egg now rests with individuals versus their employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving enough for retirement is challenging for many people, but an era of changing demographic trends, such as increased longevity and delayed marriage, can make this journey even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a recent Ipsos survey, conducted on behalf of RBC Wealth Management-U.S., 53 percent of respondents heading into retirement say they&amp;#39;re concerned about outliving their assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- CHART - END Top concerns --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Baby Boomers face increased longevity and Millennials more frequently delay marriage, there are several trends that call for a fresh way of thinking when it comes to retirement and wealth planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The modern family&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing social norms are transforming the structure and look of American families. For example, in the 1960s more than 73 percent of all children were living with two parents in their first marriage. According to the Pew Research Center, that number has more recently &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/17/1-the-american-family-today/"" target=""_blank""&gt;dropped to 46 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern family traits, such as remarriage, blended families, adult parents cohabitating with kids, and single-parent households are helping to drive this change. These factors create American families that look and function differently today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malia Haskins, vice president of wealth strategies at RBC Wealth Management-U.S. highlights some of the issues modern families may face when transitioning to retirement. She stresses the need for &amp;quot;assets to be properly titled, and for beneficiary designations to be kept up to date to ensure your retirement plans and your estate planning all work in harmony with each other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For blended families, asset titling, trusts, and other estate planning documents can be key to ensuring your wishes and legacy are carried out,&amp;quot; notes Haskins. &amp;quot;Understanding the implications of beneficiary designations and asset ownership are critical here.&amp;quot; She often suggests a pre- or post-nuptial agreement as part of the wealth planning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul DeLauro, senior vice president and manager of wealth planning at City National Bank, adds: &amp;quot;Estate planning for modern families must take into account the family dynamics that exist between the children from the couple&amp;#39;s prior marriages. Avoiding future conflict among extended family after your death is of critical importance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Women and longevity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistically, women are more likely to outlive their male counterparts, which means they will likely be left in control of the family&amp;#39;s wealth before it&amp;#39;s passed on to the next generation. They&amp;#39;re also more likely to act as a caregiver during a long-term care event, and may require &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://etf.wi.gov/news/WRS_news_012015/WRS_012015_art4.htm"" target=""_blank""&gt;long-term care themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors mean women face unique challenges in navigating their long-term financial path, preparing for risks, and marshaling the resources they&amp;#39;ll need for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=""c-black"" style=""font-size: 1em;""&gt;
&lt;h3 class=""display-iblock margin-right-10 no-marg-bottom""&gt;44%&lt;/h3&gt;
of women are most excited about spending time with family in retirement&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 65-year-old woman has a 50 percent chance of living to age 90 and a 25 percent chance of living to age 95. This compares to ages 87 and 92, respectively, for a 65-year-old man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the issue of longevity is critical for all retirees, but especially for women. Here are some things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Maximize savings&lt;/span&gt; Employer matches, catch-up contributions and other incentives may go a long way toward shoring up reserves for the future&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Grow reserves&lt;/span&gt; Continue to invest for the long-term. Maintaining an appropriate amount of growth investments may increase returns to help keep up with the rising cost of living&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Work longer&lt;/span&gt; A few extra years of pre-retirement income may have a large effect on reserves while also providing other benefits, such as health care and continued contributions to Social Security&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Consider an encore career&lt;/span&gt; Personally enriching employment that offers employer-sponsored benefits may offer flexibility, income and fulfillment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Relocate&lt;/span&gt; Reducing expenses with a lower-cost home or by moving to a low-tax state may reduce expenses as you age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeLauro sees another issue women often face. &amp;quot;Too often, financial advisors focus on the husband when dealing with married couples,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s important women ensure they work with a financial advisor who understands their unique retirement and wealth-planning needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haskins adds, &amp;quot;Women need to be strategic in how they set up their assets for retirement. Taking time out of the workforce to start a family or caring for aging parents are some of the issues that can put a strain on retirement assets.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Early retirees&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trend affecting today&amp;#39;s retirement is many people find themselves retiring earlier than they might have originally planned. Either for reasons of their own choosing, or for reasons beyond their control, 60 percent of retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned, with 61 percent citing health reasons for leaving early.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration for retirement planning is determining not only how to fund early retirement, but also how to bridge the gap between employer-sponsored health care and Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Health care options for early retirees:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Health Savings Account (HSA)&lt;/span&gt; Consider transitioning to a high-deductible health care plan and leveraging the tax benefits of saving for future health care using an HSA&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Transition to your spouse&amp;#39;s plan&lt;/span&gt; Potentially the least-expensive option, you may register as a dependent until age 65, when you may transition to Medicare&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;COBRA benefits&lt;/span&gt; Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) coverage allows you to stay on your existing plan for up to 18 months. This may be expensive, however, as continuing coverage requires you to pay the entire premium&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""meta-bold""&gt;Private health insurance&lt;/span&gt; Some retirees opt for private insurance, seeking flexibility. The ability to find a plan that works for you should be balanced with cost considerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Planning for the cost of health care in retirement is the biggest area where many early retirees fail,&amp;quot; says DeLauro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding in the costs of bridging the gap until Medicare and the longer time frame faced by early retirees may magnify these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

Who wants to think about a wealth plan when you&amp;#39;ve just outgrown a shoebox dorm room? What was it all for if not to earn money and spend it how you&amp;#39;d like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a sentiment Matt Kassera, CFP&amp;reg;, and product manager for the Advice &amp;amp; Solutions group at RBC Wealth Management-U.S., understands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It seems like once you start talking about planning, that&amp;#39;s how you have to live,&amp;rdquo; says Kassera, who considers himself a part of the older shoulder of Millennials &amp;mdash; a generation roughly defined as those born between 1981 and 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kassera says he suspects that&amp;#39;s why Millennials - a demographic accustomed to change &amp;mdash; may not think they need a financial plan. For that reason, when he&amp;#39;s working with young professionals just starting to amass their wealth, Kassera tries to approach the conversation in a more open-ended fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Life is going to continue to change,&amp;rdquo; says Kassera. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;#39;s important to you at 22 is going to be different than what&amp;#39;s important to you at 32 or 42 or 52 ... if making the most out of the time you have today is what&amp;#39;s most important to you, that&amp;#39;s where you have to begin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2019 survey conducted by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), commissioned by RBC Wealth Management, 61 percent of young professionals say the cost of living is a top concern around creating, preserving or managing their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=""https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/global-wealth"" target=""_blank""&gt;New wealth rising&lt;/a&gt; survey, which targets high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), adult children of HNWIs and high-earning professionals across the U.S., Canada, UK, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, explores the shifting landscape of global wealth. It looks at where wealth will be, what it will be invested in, how it will be invested and who is investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennial investors in the U.S. say growing their wealth is a top priority (59 percent), while 82 percent of young professionals believe they have enough time to accumulate significant wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When first putting pen to paper, young professionals should think of a financial plan as a cushion, rather than a rigid framework for finances. For example, it might be a way to enable you to take a trip to Europe while saving for the business you&amp;#39;re hoping to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wealth plan should be malleable, though there are elements that need to be in place to make it effective, says&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/p/angie-oleary/detail/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Angie O&amp;#39;Leary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, head of wealth planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S., who breaks a plan down into four pillars: an emergency fund (consisting of at least three months of savings), debt management, future savings, and expenses. In other words, &amp;quot;the key things (you) need to be thinking about,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are four tips for getting started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Divorce your debt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is something Millennials have become well-acquainted with. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://theconversation.com/millennials-are-us-1-trillion-in-debt-but-theyre-better-at-saving-than-previous-generations-112206"" target=""_blank""&gt;New York Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, this generation carries $1 trillion in debt. But it&amp;#39;s not due to home ownership or credit cards &amp;mdash; a separate&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/second-quarter-2018/accounting-age-financial-health-millennials"" target=""_blank""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank found that Millennial mortgage debt is about 15 percent lower than Generation X, and Millennial credit card debt is only two-thirds that of the previous generation. Student loans, on the other hand, are 300 percent higher for Millennials, due in large part to the rising cost of education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 2018-2019 academic year, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/best-schools/ivy-league/"" target=""_blank""&gt;average&amp;nbsp;undergraduate tuition and fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at private schools can be above $50,000 &amp;mdash; the University of Chicago, for example, is $55,000 per year. Graduate degrees carry higher costs. Obtaining an MBA at the University of Chicago costs $72,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HNW&lt;/span&gt; families, who often don&amp;#39;t qualify for financial aid, aren&amp;#39;t immune to the cost of getting a degree. And as a result, the high levels of student loan debt are delaying further wealth accumulation, O&amp;#39;Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eighteen years is the average length of a student loan payoff,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Because of that, we&amp;#39;re seeing a big shift in the latency of wealth created through buying homes, investing outside of retirement accounts and the savings rate in retirement accounts compared to the Boomers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recommends having a plan to pay off student debt at a reasonable rate while being cognizant of the interest and one&amp;#39;s ability to set aside savings. &amp;ldquo;Do a little bit of both, and maybe early on you&amp;#39;re tilting more towards paying off the debt,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;ldquo;And then as your salary increases a couple of times you can tilt it the other way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-interest debt, though, should be prioritized, says Kassera. He points to &amp;ldquo;predatory lending practices&amp;rdquo; on college campuses, where firms seek out students and give them access to credit at 18 &amp;ldquo;before they&amp;#39;ve ever been trained on how quickly that can add up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=""https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/global-wealth"" target=""_blank""&gt;New wealth rising&lt;/a&gt; survey, 31 percent of Millennial investors in the U.S. say minimizing their reliance on debt is a priority for their investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. Save for the future (both near and far)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Millennials begin their wealth journey, both short- and long-term goals can play an equally important role, Kassera says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s really important to have that long-term goal ... something you think about,&amp;rdquo; he says, adding that he also sees value in &amp;ldquo;small steps that you need to take in order to be able to achieve that long-term outcome.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having goals helps to clarify some of the abstractions that come with saving for major financial milestones, such as buying your first car, purchasing a home, getting married, having a child and retiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think some of the fear with folks defining what&amp;#39;s important to them and trying to even think about retirement is it&amp;#39;s so far away &amp;mdash; it feels like an illusion,&amp;rdquo; says Kassera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;401(k) retirement plans and Roth IRAs are a prime example of how savings can grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;#39;t look at it for the first year if you can - put it in something that&amp;#39;s going to be rebalanced regularly,&amp;rdquo; says Kassera. Then, over time, &amp;quot;you can see how quickly your savings can build up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Manage your expenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Millennials, one of the largest expenses can be related to health care. According to the 2017&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=""file-pdf"" href=""https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-264.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Millennials in the 26 to 34 range were the least likely to have medical insurance among working-age adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s common for adult kids to stay on their parent&amp;#39;s health insurance until they&amp;#39;re 26. But even if you fall into that category and have your insurance covered by your parents, it&amp;#39;s still a good idea to plan ahead for when your health insurance becomes your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Getting ahead and planning for that is super important,&amp;rdquo; O&amp;#39;Leary says, pointing to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Health Savings Accounts (HSA)&lt;/span&gt;, tax-advantaged medical savings accounts, as a tool that can help prepare for future medical expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s a triple tax benefit, so you fund it pre-tax, it grows tax-deferred and when you spend it on health care and retirement it&amp;#39;s tax-free,&amp;rdquo; says O&amp;#39;Leary. &amp;ldquo;If you can afford to save in this HSA and actually cashflow your medical expenses, it&amp;#39;s an awesome savings account.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSAs may only be attached to high-deductible insurance plans, which means what you pay every year could be more than the other plans. But Kassera points out that it has the added bonus of reducing your taxable income. &amp;ldquo;(And) also build those savings for any unforeseen medical event in the future,&amp;rdquo; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4. Review your plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your wealth evolves, Kassera recommends revisiting your plan at least annually to keep pace with changing priorities and life&amp;#39;s milestones. You also want to make sure you&amp;#39;re saving for the right things, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kassera says he often tells young professionals they&amp;#39;ve earned the ability to live where they want and join a high-end gym. &amp;ldquo;But here&amp;#39;s what you need to do to ensure you can take that dream trip to Europe next year,&amp;rdquo; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a plan should enable you to live your life, not impede it.&lt;/p&gt;

Its inventor was motivated by the promise of US$10,000 for the creation of a substitute for ivory. Ironically, as demand for ivory was devastating the world&amp;#39;s population of wild elephants, plastic was praised for its ability to &amp;ldquo;protect the natural world from the destructive forces of human need.&amp;quot; Plastics have since become ubiquitous in our society. But they are certainly no longer praised for their effect on the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The growing impact of plastics pollution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastic has significantly contributed to the planet&amp;#39;s environmental degradation for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the single-use nature of many plastic products&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the amount of time it takes for plastic products to break down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recycling, although beneficial, offers an imperfect solution. Despite recycling efforts, most plastics end up in landfills or in the environment. In fact, of the estimated nine billion tons of plastic that have ever been produced, only nine percent has been&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability"" target=""_blank""&gt;recycled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, awareness of this issue has garnered significant media attention, with a focus on the discarded plastics that have made their way into our oceans. The headlines are numerous and shocking, with images of the &amp;ldquo;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&amp;quot; and animals trapped in plastic rings. The numbers are equally alarming. Some scientists estimate that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean (by weight). Others claim there is currently anywhere between 150 million and 300 million tons of plastic floating in oceans, with&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;eight million additional tons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;entering the water each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the severity and scope of the issue, action on plastics pollution is being taken globally. The UN Environment Program launched the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.cleanseas.org/about"" target=""_blank""&gt;Clean Seas Campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in February 2017, with the goal of dramatically reducing marine litter,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;ocean plastics pollution was at the centre of discussions at the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://g7.gc.ca/en/g7-presidency/themes/working-together-climate-change-oceans-clean-energy/"" target=""_blank""&gt;2018 G7 Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and countless businesses and governments - at all levels - are making commitments to&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability"" target=""_blank""&gt;ban single-use plastic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, this action is in response to rising global sensitivity to plastics pollution, resulting in changing consumer preferences and regulatory pressure. In RBC Global Asset Management&amp;#39;s (RBC GAM) view, the prominence of this environmental issue has significant implications for investors. RBC GAM has now seen this discussion move into the boardrooms of investee companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investors speak out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps galvanized by public sentiment and regulatory developments, investors have been swift to take action on plastics pollution. Recently, investors have been filing prominent shareholder proposals in North America calling on companies to consider the impact of their product packaging on the environment. Proponents cite material financial, environmental, reputational and operational risks as reasons for support. They are asking the companies in which they&amp;#39;re invested to report on how they&amp;#39;re managing these risks. Indicative of public sentiment on the issue, shareholder proposals related to sustainable packaging have been receiving high levels of support &amp;ndash; well above the average level traditionally seen for&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/10/26/environmental-and-social-proposals-in-the-2017-proxy-season/"" target=""_blank""&gt;environmental and social shareholder proposals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The risks for business&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more companies and governments announce reduction targets related to plastics pollution, or even outright bans of plastic products, the risks associated with the use of non-sustainable packaging also increase. The UN Environment Progam&amp;#39;s 2018 report on single-use plastics found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;52 countries have some form of ban on single-use plastics at a national level&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;24 countries have a levy on single-use plastics at a national level (e.g. charging five cents for a plastic bag)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A further 18 countries have regions with some form of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/single-use-plastics-roadmap-sustainability"" target=""_blank""&gt;levy or ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks, McDonald&amp;#39;s, Ikea, American Airlines, Disney and American Express are just some of the companies that have announced high-profile bans on plastic straws. A number of companies have also committed to researching and developing a more sustainable solution. And more than 40 UK companies have signed the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/what-uk-plastics-pact"" target=""_blank""&gt;UK Plastics Pact&lt;/a&gt;. This agreement is focused on three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increasing the amount of reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensuring a greater percentage of plastic packaging is effectively recycled or composted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Generally taking action to eliminate single-use packaging by 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the plastics pollution equation is the supply side. The packaging industry has been or will be subject to developing industry trends, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;shifts in consumer behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;changing cost structures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the global trend of increased environmental regulation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the rise of e-commerce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, during the U.S. holiday season, online shopping exceeded in-store purchases for the first time. It&amp;#39;s estimated that by 2020, online shopping could account for nearly 15 percent of all global retail sales, according to MSCI ESG Research LLC. Accordingly, consumer preference for online shopping could significantly increase demand for packaging. And the growth in emerging markets has led to increased consumption in those same markets and a greater need for packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative social and environmental consequences of the packaging required to meet the world&amp;#39;s increasing demand has been met with resistance from consumers who are demanding improvements in safety and environmental impacts. In addition,the packaging industry faces increasing costs. Overall, significant investments may be required for suppliers both to meet consumer demand for sustainable packaging and to improve their environmental performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Managing plastics risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastics pollution and sustainable packaging have become a material issue for investors. This is due to the forces of changing consumer preferences, environmental regulations, pressure from industry peers making headline grabbing, anti-plastic commitments, and trends pressuring the packaging industry amidst a period of global sensitivity to plastics pollution. Significant reputational, financial,regulatory and operational risks are now associated with corporate contributions to this global issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBC GAM and its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.rbcgam.com/cgri"" target=""_blank""&gt;Corporate Governance and Responsible Investment&lt;/a&gt; (CGRI) team are committed to understanding and evaluating this evolving issue. The CGRI team, formed in 2014, advances the integration of ESG principles into investment analysis by RBC GAM&amp;#39;s investment teams, collaborates with like-minded investors and engages with lawmakers or regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Pew Research, the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/11/14/chapter-2-the-demographics-of-remarriage/"" target=""_blank""&gt;multiple marriage cohort is a growing one&lt;/a&gt;, particularly among Americans 55 and older.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;While newlyweds in their 20s or 30s may come to a marriage&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;with little but high hopes, more mature fianc&amp;eacute;es often bring with them substantial financial assets, real estate and perhaps children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People caught up in the romance of the second marriage are maybe not thinking about the financial aspects of bringing these households together,&amp;quot; says Angie O&amp;#39;Leary, head of wealth planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S. &amp;ldquo;Usually, for our clients, there&amp;#39;s wealth involved and that just brings a whole host of complexities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Full financial disclosure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing financial circumstances&amp;nbsp;can be challenging in any relationship, and this is particularly true if there is a disparity of wealth or a challenging credit history. Laying all cards on the table is a crucial first step toward setting up a financial plan and avoiding unpleasant surprises down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Full disclosure is necessary, even to the extent of pulling up credit reports for both parties, and then sitting down and reviewing them,&amp;quot; says O&amp;#39;Leary. For a spouse with significant credit card debt, this could be a potentially embarrassing situation, but this type of information is critical when a&amp;nbsp;plan can be drawn up to protect the other spouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malia Haskins, vice president, wealth strategist with RBC Wealth Management-U.S., estimates about 30 percent of her clients are in second or third marriages. She says it&amp;#39;s important to disclose early on what each spouse will bring to the marriage, both in terms of assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s about being clear about what each of you are bringing into the marriage, what the relative value of those assets may be, which of those assets are to become marital property, and which ones are going to continue to be owned individually,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes any obligations to parents or previous spouses, which may be particularly relevant if there are children involved. If one partner is paying child support, an ex-spouse could potentially seek higher support if the new marriage results in an improved financial status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also need to be clarity around&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;paying for a child&amp;#39;s education, as well as smaller issues such as who will pay for the insurance on a child&amp;#39;s new car. This may necessitate involving a previous spouse in discussions, which &amp;mdash; awkward though it may be &amp;mdash; will help ensure everyone is on the same page regarding obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Have a plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting&amp;nbsp;a plan in place&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;before the marriage&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;may not be the most romantic part of the process, but O&amp;#39;Leary recommends it. &amp;ldquo;Couples often think it&amp;#39;s something they can do after the fact, that they can worry about that later,&amp;quot; she says. But, she adds, despite their best intentions, some couples may just forget to return to the topic later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key decision is how much the&amp;nbsp;new spouses will&amp;nbsp;combine their finances. While combining might seem like the move most in line with committing to spend your lives together, sometimes it makes sense to keep things separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I see more people keeping them [assets and accounts] separate in the beginning and then taking their time to combine them. It depends on the disparity of wealth,&amp;quot; says O&amp;#39;Leary. This approach can also protect one spouse from being negatively affected if the other spouse comes into the marriage with more liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Haskins and O&amp;#39;Leary encourage couples to do a formal wealth plan, which, among other things, allows couples to view different plans for their assets, such as combined or separate, so that they can see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Other considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating your estate plan is another important consideration for anyone going into a second or third marriage. A popular misconception is that an updated will is sufficient to make sure your assets will go where you want them to. Beneficiary designations supersede a will, so it&amp;#39;s important to update beneficiaries on retirement accounts, life insurance policies, annuities and other products to reflect&amp;nbsp;the new&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;blended family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If there&amp;#39;s an untimely death, and it&amp;#39;s not updated, benefits could go to the wrong person. And there are all kinds of state and federal rules, depending on the type of account, so this stuff can get held up in court for a very long time,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question is whether to enact a prenuptial agreement to protect assets accumulated before the marriage. As unpleasant as it may be&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;to envision a divorce, particularly if one or both of the spouses have already been through one, a prenuptial agreement can help protect wealth as well as make provisions for&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;children from a previous marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The conversation about a prenup is something we encourage couples to consider if there are significant assets,&amp;quot; says Haskins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial planning around a second marriage may seem like a lot of work, but it comes with the silver lining of planning for a new life together, and all the potential that brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The emotional part of all this wealth discussion can be tough for couples, because they&amp;#39;re in love, they&amp;#39;re ready to get hitched, they&amp;#39;re dreaming about what&amp;#39;s next for them,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says. &amp;ldquo;They come in with all this baggage, but it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be negative baggage, just things that have to be sorted out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

By 2030 the share of global wealth held by Baby Boomers will be surpassed by Gen X and Millennials&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mdash;cohorts brought up in a far more interconnected, technologically savvy and globalized age. In some instances the impact of this shift will be shaped by local factors, such as demographic changes. In other instances this shift will reflect shared characteristics, as demonstrated by the greater popularity of overseas investing among younger high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) brought up in an era of globalization.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Whatever the drivers, the landscape of wealth is changing&amp;mdash;from local to global, and from one focused on returns to one founded on personal values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A more globalized investor emerges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rising economic concerns and a tradition of investor home bias&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; in large parts of the world, the new landscape of wealth appears less interested in borders. According to a survey commissioned by RBC Wealth Management&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and conducted by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), younger HNWIs are substantially more enthusiastic about foreign investing.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; The U.S. is a particularly high-profile example of a country where a long-standing preference for investments in local markets appears set to be transformed.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although part of this focus on global investment opportunities can be attributed to the natural preference among younger investors for growth, it is noticeable that their enthusiasm is backed by their business peers. Business owners and entrepreneurs (BOEs) across all ages surveyed skewed in favor of foreign investments (a trait they also share with ultra-high-net-worth individuals&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, younger investors see globalization as providing more opportunities to generate wealth than in the past&amp;mdash;again, a trend shared with BOEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mind the generation gaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new contours of the wealth map are increasingly global, this emerging population of younger investors is still choosing to invest in areas that have a social dimension. Notably, younger investors are almost twice as likely to adopt an ethical approach to investing as older investors,&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; with Asia the most enthusiastic (perhaps reflecting awareness of the rapid increase in inequality that has accompanied the region&amp;rsquo;s economic success&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;). This passion for ethical investment is echoed in their views of investing according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, with more than four fifths of younger investors viewing it as increasingly important. Alongside this interest in impact investment, there is a simultaneous willingness to experiment. Over the next five years, Millennials and Gen X investors are more keen to explore alternatives, including hedge funds and private equity, and newer asset classes like cryptocurrencies, compared with Baby Boomers.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older investors may be more likely to adopt a less risky investment strategy than their younger peers, which could be part and parcel of the older cohort&amp;rsquo;s common focus on locking in a legacy or inheritance for their children.&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Yet exploring the differences between older and younger investors can lead to some unexpected conclusions; for example, there exists a widespread perception that Millennials and Gen Z value unique experiences such as travel and sports more than material goods,&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; but our survey found this to be equally true of older investors.&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of note, older HNWIs&amp;rsquo; investments are not necessarily as conservative as one might assume. For example, when it comes to their preferences over the next five years, older investors (particularly men) choose the technology sector more often than younger investors. They are also increasingly exploring newer investment vehicles, such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), with a quarter of the older cohort saying ETFs align with their investment preferences (compared with 17 percent of those in the 18&amp;ndash;54 age range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;FIGURE 2: Exploring options&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Which of the following asset classes, if any, most aligns with your investment preferences? (Percentage of respondents)&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=""highcharts-iframe"" src=""https://cloud.highcharts.com/embed/jbpRgZq2z/"" style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 520px""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Wary but confident&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All investors, regardless of age, express some jitters about the state of the global and domestic economy, although these worries run particularly deep among the younger cohort. Almost 60 percent of younger investors report they are concerned about ensuring their financial well-being, about twice the level of Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation. Their unease primarily centers on domestic issues, such as the rising cost of living and changing employment opportunities. Older and wealthier investors, on the other hand, are more likely to cite global economic uncertainty and tariff barriers as their key issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;FIGURE 3: Fear factors&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Which of the following external factors most concern you about your ability to create, preserve or manage your wealth? (Percentage of respondents selecting each option)&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=""highcharts-iframe"" src=""https://cloud.highcharts.com/embed/1j0kUJo7q/"" style=""border: 0; width: 100%; height: 520px""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this uncertainty has not bred pessimism; four fifths of younger investors say they are confident they will reach their financial goals for creating, preserving and managing their wealth. Admittedly, they acknowledge getting there will not be easy&amp;mdash;more than three quarters of respondents agree that today&amp;rsquo;s market requires investors to be far more flexible and responsive in their investment strategies, as well as more attentive to their portfolio. Nonetheless, despite the backdrop of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, the new holders of wealth appear confident and ready to not only face the future, but reshape it.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1994, then World Bank chief economist Larry Summers wrote, &amp;ldquo;investment in girls&amp;rsquo; education may well be the highest return investment available in the developing world.&amp;rdquo; Almost twenty-five years later, the &lt;a href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;World Economic Forum&amp;rsquo;s 2018 Global Gender Gap Report&lt;/a&gt; highlighted that &amp;ldquo;the progress toward parity continues to be very slow&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the population-weighted average overall gap is virtually unchanged from last year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment and economic growth are highly correlated. &lt;a href=""https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/infographics/why-invest-in-women"" target=""_blank""&gt;According to USAID&lt;/a&gt;, a country&amp;rsquo;s GDP can be expected to increase an average of 3% for every 10% more girls who go to school. Furthermore, these gains are not limited by geography or development&amp;mdash;the U.S. can add up to $4.3 trillion in annual GDP in 2025 by closing the gender gap, per the &lt;a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Employment%20and%20Growth/The%20power%20of%20parity%20Advancing%20womens%20equality%20in%20the%20United%20States/MGI-Power-of-Parity-in-US-Full-report-April-2016.ashx"" target=""_blank""&gt;McKinsey Global Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve gender equality, and support continued global development, we need to properly invest in organizations that address women&amp;rsquo;s and girls&amp;rsquo; issues. According to the &lt;a href=""https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/21011/wgi-report.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;Women &amp;amp; Girls Index&lt;/a&gt; released by the Women&amp;rsquo;s Philanthropy Institute last month, &lt;strong&gt;nonprofit organizations dedicated to women and girls account for only 3.3% of all nonprofit organizations in the U.S. and received only 1.6% of all charitable donations made in 2016&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in women and girls can yield higher social and financial returns. Nonprofits with a women-and-girls-focused mission &amp;ldquo;achieve powerful results, driving significant progress for women and girls while operating with lower levels of philanthropic support and fewer staff resources than many other charities,&amp;rdquo; according to Andrea Pactor, interim director of the Women&amp;rsquo;s Philanthropy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, all these statements and statistics underscore the depth and breadth of the global gender inequality issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Etergino Group&amp;rsquo;s mission is to &lt;em&gt;connect wealth with purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We work&amp;nbsp;with individuals and organizations to build investment portfolios with the aim of achieving maximum risk-adjusted returns while also choosing investments that are aligned with our clients&amp;rsquo; specific values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commitment to our team&amp;rsquo;s mission extends far beyond the office. Ann Marie is passionate about promoting financial literacy and she volunteers her time and talents to worthy causes supporting the needs of women and children. She serves on the boards of Women for Women International, a non-profit humanitarian organization that provides economic and social support to women survivors of war, as well as Collegiate Directions, a non-profit that helps low-income, first-generation students from the Washington area to apply, attend, and succeed in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ann Marie has witnessed the impact of investing in women. During a Women for Women training program in Rwanda, Ann Marie saw first-hand how providing women with job skills, tools and resources not only allows them to support their families financially, but also boosts their confidence and dignity. Ann Marie was especially moved by Anika, a recent program graduate who had learned how to grow and sell pineapple locally, all so Anika could earn the income needed to send her son to school. The investment in Anika empowered her to support her family and her community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that stronger women leads to stronger returns, which results in stronger communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to invest in women. Giving your time or making a donation to a charitable organization focused on women&amp;rsquo;s and girls&amp;rsquo; issues is one option. Another is to consider allocating your portfolio with a focus on socially responsible investments &amp;mdash; connecting positive returns with positive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple changes to how you invest may lead to a positive impact on not only your financial wellbeing, but also the causes important to you.

".org",".org","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Young high-net-worth investors' mindset and technological savvy spurs global investing","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;Despite U.S.-based indexes reaching new highs over the course of a multi-year bull run,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; U.S. investors&amp;rsquo; mindset is becoming more global. According to a survey by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), commissioned by RBC Wealth Management, the preference for domestic investing is less pronounced among younger Americans than older ones.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The survey looked at various bands of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs; respondents with at least US$1MM in investable assets), adult children of HNWIs, and those who are not HNWIs but who have a minimum income of US$100,000.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; It revealed a more diverse investment approach from the next generation, which could expand in scope and scale as successive generations acquire wealth. This is important because the priorities, aspirations and concerns of this new generation will shape the global wealth map for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The appeal of the U.S. market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By many measures, the U.S. has the world&amp;rsquo;s most developed financial markets, including the world&amp;rsquo;s two largest stock exchanges.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; According to the EIU, the U.S. ranks first globally in terms of market dynamics that contribute to wealth generation.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. companies are typically international in their approach, but Americans&amp;rsquo; appetite for domestic investment is still strong, with 58 percent of U.S. investors saying they do not hold any foreign investments&amp;mdash;nearly twice the average of the other surveyed markets.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when it comes to preferences, 46 percent of U.S. investors say they prefer domestic investment over foreign, compared with just 21 percent who favour foreign investments (the rest being neutral). But this picture shifts among younger investors. Enthusiasm for foreign investments increases in a near linear fashion from the older generations to the younger cohort: for example, just six percent of baby boomers prefer foreign investments over domestic (and 25 percent neutral), compared with 23 percent of Gen X (34 percent neutral), and 29 percent of Millennials (30 percent neutral)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;FIGURE 1: Bridging borders&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;How will your investment strategy change in the next five years (Percentage choosing more foreign investment, by country/region)&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="""" src=""/documents/10192/0/highcharts-iframe1.JPG/7aca7428-77d8-43d5-a786-1fd5d11e97e0?t=1574200260000"" style=""width: 814px; height: 664px;"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""disclaimer""&gt;&amp;ldquo;Home bias tends to be lower among younger investors, who may have less experience with foreign currency losses,&amp;rdquo; says Rachel Ziemba, founder of political and economic risk analysis firm Ziemba Insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to Bill O&amp;rsquo;Connor, dean of the Vault Innovation Academy and director of Vault Innovation Services, which focuses on helping companies with innovation, greater international exposure among younger investors also plays a role. &amp;ldquo;A more global mindset is definitely part of younger people investing more overseas: they&amp;rsquo;ve grown up in a technology-saturated, globally connected era,&amp;rdquo; O&amp;rsquo;Connor says. &amp;ldquo;This knowledge of and intimacy with people all around the world naturally has had an expansive effect on where they feel comfortable investing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These views of younger U.S. investors align with the more global mindset of Americans at the highest wealth levels (US$5MM+ in investable assets); only 40 percent in this group do not hold foreign investments, compared with 66 percent of HNWIs with between US$1MM and 5MM in investable assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;U.S. investors seek diversification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investors in the U.S. who do invest in foreign markets, their investments are fairly evenly dispersed among asset classes. Twenty-one percent of younger Americans invest in foreign real estate (compared with just two percent of older Americans), and 20 percent in business-related investments, such as foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;FIGURE 2: Outward bound&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Which of the following investments/holdings do you have outside of&lt;br /&gt;
the country in which you live? (Percent of U.S.-based respondents choosing each option)&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="""" src=""/documents/10192/0/highcharts-iframe2.JPG/477bf58c-76c5-4b40-a50f-30d28981c11f?t=1574200285000"" style=""width: 866px; height: 605px;"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For younger investors, their foreign investment choices could relate to a desire to spread their risks, with more younger Americans (23 percent) than older ones (16 percent) wanting to ensure greater diversification over the next five years. The drivers of these risks include worries originating from both home and abroad (about one-third of respondents cite concerns about both global and domestic economic uncertainty).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Access to information about foreign markets on the rise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing interest in foreign investments could also reflect the extent to which ease of travel and the role of technology are making the world smaller. U.S. survey respondents cite better education, access to the internet/new technologies and greater access to financial planning resources as top factors behind why opportunities to generate wealth have increased. As such, the overall pie of foreign investing appears likely to grow once successive generations come of age and acquire the means to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, gaining exposure to international markets through foreign investments does not need to come at the expense of the domestic market. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found foreign investment by U.S. multinational companies has historically been linked to greater investments domestically too.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same could be true of individual investors, with rising wealth levels enabling HNWIs to increase their domestic and foreign allocations simultaneously. As a result, younger Americans&amp;rsquo; increased openness to foreign investing, especially if it is accompanied by higher returns, could end up being a positive for U.S. capital markets as well.&lt;/p&gt;

".org",".org","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Why a power of attorney should be part of your retirement plans","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;While most people understand the value of a long-term income strategy and&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;estate plan, many fail to consider the importance of designating a power of attorney (POA) until a serious medical event occurs. And at that point, it may be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an issue that should be addressed well in advance of when you need it. With a POA designation in place, somebody will be in a legal position to act on your behalf if you&amp;#39;re suddenly incapacitated and unable to make decisions. You can become incapacitated and unable to handle your own financial affairs at any age - say, in the case of an accident or an unexpected health issue - but the risk increases as you grow older, says Tara Ambrose, manager, Senior &amp;amp; Vulnerable Client Initiatives, at RBC Wealth Management-U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A durable financial POA can step in to handle your financial matters when you&amp;#39;re no longer able to, or when you no longer wish to retain control. This is distinct from a&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;health care&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;POA, which only allows you to delegate important medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;#39;re already retired or about to be, you should give serious thought to making a power of attorney designation,&amp;quot; Ambrose says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Identifying the right designate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can name a family member, friend or even a professional (such as an attorney) to take on POA responsibilities. The goal is to identify someone who will be able to act as a trusted and reliable surrogate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The trust factor is critical,&amp;quot; says Ambrose, &amp;ldquo;because you don&amp;#39;t want to be exposed to a situation where the person with the POA designation takes advantage of their position.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Married couples may consider their spouse to be the potential surrogate they would trust the most, but as both grow older, each person could lose the capacity to make decisions. In such cases, it may make sense to name someone else, such as a trusted family member, to carry the responsibility. It is important when establishing a POA designation to name successors who can step in if the primary designate is no longer able to fulfill the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Roles and responsibilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two primary parties involved in the POA arrangement are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The principal, who identifies the individual or entity who will be responsible for making decisions if the principal is longer able to; and,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The agent, the individual or entity designated to fulfill the POA role. This is also known as attorney-in-fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal should carefully consider the specific powers granted to the agent in the POA document. Should the agent be able to change beneficiaries or gift money to themselves or others? These powers, if exploited by an agent,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;may lead to abuse&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and family disputes. Carefully read through each section of the POA document before signing or discuss with your attorney how to create your POA document so that it limits possible exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent may not be familiar with the fiduciary role to which they&amp;#39;ve been appointed. It&amp;#39;s important the agent understands their&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/managing-someone-elses-money/power-attorney-guides/""&gt;four primary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make decisions in the best interests of the principal, superseding the agent&amp;#39;s own interests, or those of others.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Manage money and property with care on behalf of the principal, ensuring that bills are paid, debts are collected and all investment decisions are prudent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never co-mingle the principal&amp;#39;s money or property with anybody else&amp;#39;s, and avoid reimbursing yourself with the principal&amp;#39;s personal funds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep accurate records of all financial transactions, including payments, expenses and investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Be aware of your state&amp;#39;s laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to establish a POA designation is something individuals can take upon themselves without having to deal with courts. The POA designation is, however, a legal document, and in many states you&amp;#39;re required to complete appropriate paperwork and notarize all signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s important to comply with the laws of your state,&amp;quot; says Tara Ruedy, a paralegal with RBC Wealth Management-U.S. who regularly reviews POA arrangements. &amp;ldquo;There is general uniformity in the laws among different states, but some states are very specific in defining the power of attorney role, while others are less so.&amp;quot; Ruedy recommends that a POA designation outline very specific guidelines to direct the actions of the individual selected for the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A sense of urgency is appropriate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know when a health issue will arise that may leave you unable to manage your own financial affairs. That could be a physical issue, or, as is becoming more likely in recent years,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;a cognitive one; according to the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""file-pdf"" href=""https://www.alz.org/aaic/_downloads/mon-930am-baby-boomers.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association&lt;/a&gt;, the number of Americans living with dementia could triple by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a POA is designated prior to your becoming unable to manage your affairs, you&amp;#39;ll be prepared. But, with no such designation in place, significant issues can occur that may complicate your financial life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Try to avoid doing it at the last minute, or failing to do it at all,&amp;quot; says Ambrose, adding that it&amp;#39;s also important to keep the designation updated by reviewing it frequently. If a person no longer has the capacity to make a designation, she explains, other measures will be required that will make the process of managing financial matters more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though an attorney isn&amp;#39;t required, Ruedy suggests working with one anyway to ensure documents are drawn up correctly and with appropriate specifications. &amp;ldquo;If an attorney is feasible for you to consider, it makes sense to enlist those services,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for potential incapacity in the future should be part of your retirement and estate planning conversations. A POA designation can give you peace of mind that your interests will be protected if something unexpected happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=""headline-field js-story-headline js-commentable""&gt;As parents age and health declines, there will likely come a time when you need to get involved in their finances. While having those conversations around finances can be uncomfortable and awkward, doing so sooner rather than later can help protect them from financial missteps.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""js-story-text js-commentable"" notranslate=""""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s inevitable that at some point the financial keys will need to be handed off to somebody,&amp;quot; says&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""/us/en/p/angie-oleary/detail/?p=e""&gt;Angie O&amp;#39;Leary&lt;/a&gt;, head of Wealth Planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S. &amp;quot;Either you plan now, or you don&amp;#39;t, and then it becomes a crisis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Protecting the elderly from fraud and illness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks of avoiding important discussions with your parents as they age could be financially ruinous.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Financial fraud&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;targeting the elderly costs victims anywhere from US$2.9 billion to $36 billion a year, according to a 2017 Senate report from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley. &amp;quot;Due to its scope and persistently low reporting rates, elder financial exploitation has been dubbed the crime of the 21st century,&amp;quot;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;the report states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concurrent rise in age-related cognitive diseases is one factor fueling the growth of elder financial fraud. With each passing minute in a day, another person develops Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures"" target=""_blank""&gt;according to the nonprofit Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association&lt;/a&gt;. The organization forecasts approximately 14 million U.S. residents becoming afflicted with that form of dementia by 2050. People are now living longer than ever, but with age comes an increased risk of cognitive illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tara Ambrose, manager for Senior &amp;amp; Vulnerable Client Initiatives at RBC Wealth Management-U.S.,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;tells a cautionary tale&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;of one client who didn&amp;#39;t understand that her husband had dementia. The husband lost their entire financial nest egg through making bad business decisions and failing to pay taxes, Ambrose says, &amp;quot;and by the time she got involved, everything was gone.&amp;quot; Eventually, the couple had to declare bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the potential for fraud or age-related diseases can&amp;#39;t be eliminated, family members can mitigate the impact by discussing those issues and other financial topics with their parents as they age. Those talks may not be easy, but the sooner they begin the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Planning early and making the conversations about financial safety and security helps eliminate some of the emotional charge,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How to start the conversation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such important conversations can be tough for families, but one method to get parents comfortable with the idea of someone else looking after their finances is to shadow them. &amp;quot;It can be better if you can walk alongside them before you have to completely take over,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option is offering to periodically review Mom and Dad&amp;#39;s accounts with them for potential problems. That could happen as little as once a month, when many bills get paid. &amp;quot;In my husband&amp;#39;s case,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says, &amp;quot;at the beginning, he was double-checking his parents&amp;#39; finances and meeting with them monthly. Now he has full financial capacity for them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t be surprised if attempts at discussing your parents&amp;#39; finances don&amp;#39;t go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sometimes the parents feel ambushed,&amp;quot; Ambrose says. &amp;quot;If they shut you down, then respect that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a different approach, or a different messenger, Ambrose explains, such as suggesting your parents talk with a respected professional like a financial advisor or an attorney, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Get estate documents in order&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s vitally important for families to have key legacy documents in place - and ensure they are current. First is the will, a document that details how an estate should get distributed. Most people understand the benefits of a will in estate planning, and that without one, heirs will likely be left grappling with government bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps less understood is the need for a&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;power of attorney&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(POA) and a living will. Both are important when people start to lose their cognitive ability, Ambrose explains. A POA allows designated individuals to act on behalf of Mom or Dad in financial and legal matters, and can get drafted in a variety of ways. One option would let simple investment decisions get made, while another could encompass all financial transactions, including check-writing privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s vital to get the POA signed before a parent becomes incapacitated; if you don&amp;#39;t, it restricts what you can do to help them meet their financial obligations. At that point, you&amp;#39;ll need additional legal action to address your parent&amp;#39;s incapacity and appoint a guardian or conservator. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a last resort, and the outcome is not guaranteed,&amp;quot; Ambrose says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A living will, otherwise known as an advance healthcare directive, details under what circumstances your parents would like to refuse medical treatment if they become incapacitated. Exactly what goes into this document will require a detailed discussion of your parents&amp;#39; desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;quot;Care preferences are a big part of the discussion,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says. For example, do your parents want to age at home, or in a care home? &amp;quot;That should be considered early on,&amp;quot; she adds.

&lt;p&gt;A lack of a signed advance healthcare directive can leave you at the mercy of medical professionals. Doctors and nurses are required to follow strict rules, some of which may not match the desires of you or your parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are so many laws when it comes to transferring legal, financial and health care capacity,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says. &amp;quot;Without proper planning, the inevitable can turn into a crisis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the economic risks posed by the pandemic, the federal government is unveiling new measures to help. In early April, the Federal Reserve announced it would provide as much as $2.3 trillion to aid small- and mid-sized businesses as well as state and local governments. That announcement followed&amp;nbsp;President Donald Trump signing the&amp;nbsp;Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act&amp;nbsp;into law in late March to provide help for individuals, nonprofits and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every small business, including those that are still operating and those that want to reopen, may be able to benefit from the provisions of the CARES Act,&amp;quot; says&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=""/us/en/p/angie-oleary/detail/?p=e""&gt;Angie O&amp;#39;Leary&lt;/a&gt;, head of wealth planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S. &amp;ldquo;The act also provides relief for nonprofit organizations and for sole proprietors, independent contractors and self-employed individuals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more than 30 million small businesses in the U.S. &amp;mdash; categorized as those with fewer than 500 employees &amp;mdash; and nearly half (49.2 percent) of the nation&amp;#39;s workforce is employed by a small business, according to&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/small-business-statistics/"" target=""_blank""&gt;recent statistics from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous provisions in the CARES Act that could benefit small businesses, but one of the most compelling is the Payroll Protection Program (PPP), says Daniel Sullivan, a wealth strategist with RBC Wealth Management-U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The PPP provides a loan that will be forgiven to the extent that it&amp;#39;s used to pay employees, the rent or mortgage interest, and utilities during the eight-week period from the loan date,&amp;quot; says Sullivan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loans can be as large as 2.5 times the monthly payroll, mortgage, rent and debt payment expenses, up to $10 million. The funds from these loans can be used for multiple business expenses, including paid sick leave and payments on existing debts. There are no fees or prepayment penalties on the loans, which are fully guaranteed by the government through 2020 and guaranteed up to 75 to 85 percent of the original loan in 2021 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;First steps for business owners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Small Business Administration (SBA) opened the loan application process on April 3, 2020 and provides&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources"" target=""_blank""&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;through its site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The PPP program is most important for companies that are trying to stay open or want to rehire their employees and reopen,&amp;quot; says O&amp;#39;Leary. &amp;ldquo;Business owners who are not able to stay open can reach out to their furloughed and laid-off employees to communicate with them about extra unemployment benefits available through the act and encourage them to rejoin the company when things improve.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business owners should immediately reach out to their financial advisor and tax specialist, Sullivan recommends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What makes the PPP special is that it&amp;#39;s a potentially forgivable loan that doesn&amp;#39;t require collateral or a personal guarantee,&amp;quot; Sullivan says. &amp;ldquo;Usually there&amp;#39;s an income tax consequence when a debt is forgiven, but in this case, there won&amp;#39;t be a tax liability if the PPP criteria are satisfied.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your banker must be an SBA loan provider to participate in the program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gwen Miller, executive vice president for RBC Banking Solutions at City National Bank, says the bank has processed thousands of loan applications for clients who own small businesses and seen more than $3 billion in emergency relief approved by the SBA in just the first week of the Payroll Protection Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are moving full steam ahead with all the bank&amp;#39;s resources aimed at getting these funds to our clients so they can keep their businesses open and save jobs,&amp;quot; Miller says. Businesses need to continue to act quickly, she explains, connecting with their current bank to assist with the application process as these funds are limited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;ll need a copy of your payroll tax report and other documents when you apply for the loan,&amp;quot; adds Sullivan. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s also extremely important to document all your payments during the eight-week loan period because you&amp;#39;ll need that for the loan to be forgiven.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the PPP may provide the most immediate relief for employers and employees, the CARES Act also has several other elements that can be helpful. However, most of these cannot be combined, so it&amp;#39;s best to discuss the following options with your accountant and financial advisor:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Employers are eligible to defer 50 percent of payroll taxes until Dec. 31, 2021, with the remaining 50 percent due Dec. 31, 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Employers who have partially or completely suspended their business, or who have seen a more than 50 percent reduction in gross receipts compared to 2019, may be eligible for an employee retention credit, which is a payroll tax credit for employment taxes equal to 50 percent of wages (up to $10,000 per employee) paid to employees who are not working due to the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An expansion of the SBA Disaster Loan Program, which is a low-interest loan for up to $2 million with a maturity of up to 30 years. A $10,000 emergency advance will be paid within three days of the loan application while the full loan approval is pending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An SBA Express loan, which can be processed within 36 hours, is available for up to $1 million through Dec. 31, 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Businesses with a net operating loss (NOL) may be able to claim a refund for NOLs from 2018, 2019 and 2020 or choose to carry those forward to offset taxable income in future years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The amount of business interest expenses that can be deducted has been increased for 2019 and 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While it&amp;#39;s smart to apply as soon as possible for government assistance, business owners should talk to their banker, CPA and attorney to make sure they understand the ins-and-outs of these evolving programs and any tax and legal implications,&amp;quot; says Sullivan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Nonprofit assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many business owners are also active with nonprofit organizations that can apply for SBA assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These loans are a lifeline that make a difference between a nonprofit being viable or not,&amp;quot; O&amp;#39;Leary says. &amp;quot;For example, I&amp;#39;m on the board of an organization applying for help now that supports women recovering from drug and alcohol abuse, work that is possibly even more essential to keep going now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies that have pivoted to provide their communities with assistance during the crisis, or have the means to continue their philanthropic efforts, the CARES Act also raises the limit on&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://insidecharity.org/2020/03/28/cares-act-for-nonprofits/"" target=""_blank""&gt;tax deductible donations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;from 10 to 25 percent of a corporation&amp;#39;s taxable profits. Food donations are also tax deductible up to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Other sources of help for businesses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the resources provided by the federal government, numerous local, regional and state programs are available for business owners, says Sullivan. He recommends the CASE Center at Duke University&amp;#39;s regularly updated and searchable&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.appsheet.com/start/b623f7ad-9fc1-4f97-9d0e-f44983032d2a#appName=COVIDResource-1340872&amp;amp;group=%5B%5D&amp;amp;page=card&amp;amp;sort=%5B%7B%22Column%22%3A%22Location%22%2C%22Order%22%3A%22Ascending%22%7D%5D&amp;amp;table='Target+Geography+(Global%2C+National%2C+Regional)'+is+Regional&amp;amp;view=Regional+Relief"" target=""_blank""&gt;dashboard of small business relief programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no company could be prepared for the global magnitude of COVID-19, contingency planning for all businesses should include establishing both cash reserves and access to a line of credit to increase resiliency, Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen it needlepointed on a pillow in someone&amp;rsquo;s living room. Or, maybe someone has reminded us that if we &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t have our health, we don&amp;rsquo;t have anything.&amp;rdquo; Truisms that manage to both highlight and hide the complexity of the interconnections between our physical health, mental health, and financial well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Courtney Jordan Baechler, medical director of emerging science centers at the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation, says that no matter our race or gender, genomically&amp;mdash;that is, the makeup of our genes&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re 99 percent the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet women are twice as likely to develop generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, adds Dr. Jordan Baechler. Women also earn an average of 82 cents on the dollar compared to men, according to the &lt;a class=""file-pdf"" href=""https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;National Partnership for Women &amp;amp; Families&lt;/a&gt;, and 75 percent of caregivers are women, whether they&amp;rsquo;re caring for their children, parents or another family member, according to the &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.caregiver.org/caregiver-statistics-demographics"" target=""_blank""&gt;Family Caregiver Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those are objective health stats,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Jordan Baechler says. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be an award-winning scientist to know something is going on in our society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Health determines wealth, and vice versa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as 80 percent of our health is determined by what medical professionals call the 12 social determinants of health. According to &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-of-health"" target=""_blank""&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Social determinants of health are conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.&amp;rdquo; This includes how much money we make, which is tied to how much power we feel we have or we&amp;rsquo;re able to wield, and how much we exercise or treat ourselves right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jordan Baechler says wealth, or lack thereof, is something she regularly sees as having a profound impact on her patients&amp;rsquo; relative health. Compared to higher net worth individuals, she says, individuals with lower incomes have lower self-reported health and greater health risks for chronic conditions. And on the other end of the spectrum, she sees patients who have financial stability but are constantly working at the expense of their health. When stress levels are high, whether from worrying about money or pressure at work, our body&amp;rsquo;s primary stress hormone, cortisol, kicks in. The danger to our health, she says, comes when our stress-response system is constantly activated and we&amp;rsquo;re overexposed to that stress hormone. &amp;ldquo;We have to work hard and smart at our jobs, health, and finances,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Burning out your cortisol is a recipe for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Train for the best outcome&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angie O&amp;rsquo;Leary, head of Wealth Planning at RBC Wealth Management-U.S., underscores this theory. &amp;ldquo;Health and wealth will be forever intertwined, and as you age, it becomes even more intertwined,&amp;rdquo; she says. Better health can reduce health care spending, says O&amp;rsquo;Leary, and better financial planning can reduce some of the stress that Dr. Jordan Baechler points out can lead to poor health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Women who get a financial advisor&amp;mdash;just like getting a physical trainer or dietician&amp;mdash;are likely to see better outcomes. They&amp;rsquo;ll have greater confidence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Leary stresses that a financial advisor isn&amp;rsquo;t going to say you have to give up wellness or self-care costs to save only for the future&amp;mdash;one of the pillars of good financial health is planning for your spending later &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for your spending now. In fact, a good advisor will see those costs as wise investments, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the close but oft overlooked relationship between health and wealth that prompted RBC Wealth Management to host an event on the topic geared toward women last year. The goal was to encourage women not only to link the two, but to be planful and proactive on both fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristen Kimmell, head of advisor recruiting and field marketing at RBC Wealth Management-U.S., who led the charge on creating the RBC event, compares financial planning to preventative health care, which can help prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I talk to women and ask if they have a financial advisor, many will say, &amp;lsquo;My stuff&amp;#39;s not in order,&amp;rsquo; but that&amp;rsquo;s like saying, &amp;lsquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t go to the gym until I&amp;rsquo;m in shape,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; says Kimmell.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re getting more accepting of health coaches. We need to expand coaching to financial health as well and start seeing financial health as preventive. You can prevent some pretty major mistakes in your financial success if you work with someone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Generational factors to wellness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual health, there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting link between generational health and economic wellbeing. According to a &lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.bcbs.com/the-health-of-america/reports/how-millennials-current-and-future-health-could-affect-our-economy?utm_source=linked_in&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=hoa_q419&amp;amp;utm_term=national&amp;amp;utm_content=moody%27s_report_3"" target=""_blank""&gt;2019 data analysis from Blue Cross Blue Shield&lt;/a&gt;, Millennials are seeing their health decline faster than the previous generation, both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Cross Blue Shield study summarizes that &amp;ldquo;Poorer health among Millennials will keep them from contributing as much to the economy as they otherwise would.&amp;rdquo; This is where preventive care and wellness become paramount&amp;mdash;the basic pillars of good diet, exercise and sleep&amp;mdash;to turn those numbers around. And the pillars of financial health also come into play to bolster economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials aren&amp;rsquo;t the only generation with lifestyle factors to consider. Kimmell notes that Boomer women often outlive male spouses, and longer lifespans make planning for the future&amp;mdash;another financial health pillar&amp;mdash;even more integral to our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety about your economic future is damaging to mental health, Kimmell says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know if we eat a diet higher in vegetables and lower in fat, that&amp;rsquo;s preventive healthcare. We&amp;rsquo;ve learned to ask ourselves, &amp;lsquo;How do I prevent a heart attack?&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; Kimmell says. &amp;ldquo;Now we have to learn to ask, &amp;lsquo;How do I prevent a crisis of turning 50 and not having considered retirement yet?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan Baechler agrees. &amp;ldquo;[Women] put ourselves last all the time. [Women] tend to prioritize everything besides our own health. We say, &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this, I&amp;rsquo;m too busy&amp;rsquo; but we&amp;rsquo;re leaving smart dollars, investments, and future stability on the table. How do we make it easier to help people feel good and accomplish all areas&amp;mdash;career, health, and investment&amp;mdash;because they&amp;rsquo;re so interconnected?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

".org",".org","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Video streaming: Cord-cutting in the time of COVID-19","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p class=""italic""&gt;This report is part of the &amp;ldquo;New normal, new opportunities&amp;rdquo; series, in which we examine secular trends in a post-COVID-19 world. The series will cover a range of themes that are emerging as a result of social distancing, the work-from-home imperative, health care developments, corporate implications, and broader societal change. We believe identifying these trends and understanding their investment implications will be critical to navigating the road ahead. Additional reports will be released over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, continued price hikes in pay TV, a proliferation of video streaming services offering high-quality content, and households&amp;rsquo; desire for more customized viewing options have underscored the cord-cutting&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; phenomenon. We believe that the pandemic has magnified the value proposition of video streaming given better economics, access to high-quality content, and greater control of the viewing experience, and could potentially accelerate the cord-cutting and cord-shaving&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""arial footnote""&gt;Cord-cutting: The process of cancelling a cable or satellite subscription and getting TV shows and movies by other means. Most often, this involves switching to video streaming services that can be accessed via the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""arial footnote""&gt;Cord-shaving: Keeping one&amp;rsquo;s cable TV subscription, but cancelling all the costly channels, packages, and add-ons. As a result, household cable bills drop significantly, while retaining some of the essential basic channels, along with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Video streaming goes viral&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the vast majority of the workforce at home, a fear of public spaces, an inability to enjoy live events, and the pause of live sports (until recently), it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that households are relying on home entertainment as a means of passing time and leisure in the midst of this pandemic. An April report published by Nielson cited that time spent streaming videos from services including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video more than doubled from a year ago as a result of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, based on a cord-cutting study published by Roku in July of this year, cord-cutting hit a milestone in the midst of the pandemic with nearly one in three U.S. TV households without traditional pay TV subscriptions (cable, satellite, telco), while another 25 percent of households identified as cord-shavers and cut back their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has given households the opportunity to reassess their home entertainment experience and what they are willing to pay for it. Ultimately, the Roku study suggests that COVID-19 is in fact favorably influencing the shift to streaming. When asked about the intent to cut the cord fully in the next six months, 45 percent of cord-shavers indicated they were likely to do so. The focus on value is key, with 40 percent of recent cord-cutters deciding to cut traditional pay TV services as a result of access to free trials and premium subscription services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the absence of live sports events on traditional pay TV services earlier on during the pandemic no doubt facilitated the acceleration in cord-cutting and greater adoption of streaming services, at the time the survey was taken it was questionable as to whether cord-cutters would resubscribe to traditional pay TV in order to regain access to live sports. Interestingly, according to the survey, only 17 percent of recent cord-cutting households indicated that this would be the case. One-third of households said they would likely subscribe to a live sports streaming service, and over half of traditional and cord-shaver households said that they would likely reduce their package if televised sports on traditional pay TV did not return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cord-cutting and cord-shaving on the rise as households prioritize value&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, major cable and satellite TV operators collectively lost around 5.8 million subscribers in the U.S., more than double that lost in 2018, according to protocol.com. We believe these changes are driven primarily by households&amp;rsquo; desire to lower expenses by switching to cheaper video streaming alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the fact that the vast majority of households with a cable bundle end up with a host of channels they don&amp;rsquo;t watch, while also paying a disproportionate amount of their monthly income towards their cable package. A recent report published by DecisionData.org in March of this year found that the average U.S. consumer pays more for their cable package&amp;mdash;an average monthly cost of $217.42, of which TV services constitute 50 percent&amp;mdash;than they do for most other household utilities combined. Further, the average cable bill stays relatively similar across household sizes, whether one or more people live there&amp;mdash;though this is not true of other utilities such as electricity or water. Notably, cable bills have steadily been on the rise and despite the pandemic, there are few signs that annual price hikes will abate anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe households that cut the cord can economically redirect those savings towards multiple streaming subscriptions. Consider the fact that the average U.S. household pays around $100 per month for pay TV services. Even if a household were to sign up for subscriptions to, for example, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video (for non-Prime members), Disney+, and AppleTV+, they would still be retaining close to 60 percent of those savings (see table).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Potential savings from cord-cutting &amp;amp; switching to multiple streaming subscriptions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ample runway for cord-cutting over the next several years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a strong shift towards cord-cutting globally, particularly in the U.S., over the last several years, we believe there is an ample runway for this megatrend to continue on a multiyear basis. Statista projects revenue in the global video streaming segment to reach $51.6 billion in 2020&amp;mdash;a 16 percent increase year over year. Over the next five years, revenue is expected to grow at an annual compounded rate of 10.7 percent, or to $85.7 billion by 2025. Note that the penetration rate, despite robust growth over the last several years, was just under 11 percent in 2019. This is expected to expand to approximately 17 percent by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the focus on value as a driving force of cord-cutting cannot be understated, we believe there are other factors that will potentially magnify this megatrend over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the desire for personalized content coupled with greater control of the viewing experience will augment the secular growth trend of video streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as the subscriber base for a subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider grows, this creates a giant data set that can be mined to better understand customers&amp;rsquo; viewing behaviors and preferences, and ultimately used to purchase or create better content. The data should empower the provider to not only strengthen its relationship with its customer base but also attract new customers to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, technological advances related to improved network speeds should enable SVOD service providers to deliver high-definition videos at a faster streaming rate. These faster speeds, coupled with the proliferation of connected devices such as smart TVs, smartphones, and tablets, will enhance the growth of the broader streaming &amp;ldquo;ecosystem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Recent extreme weather in the U.S. stretching from the Upper Midwest down to Texas, just the latest in a growing string of once-in-several-hundred-year climate disasters, is a stark reminder of the pressing need to tackle this issue. We look at the implications of climate change for portfolio management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A new beginning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As pledged during the campaign, the Biden administration is treating climate change as a top priority. One of Biden&amp;rsquo;s first acts after his inauguration was to rejoin the Paris climate accord via executive order. Former President Donald Trump had exited this treaty, which binds nearly 200 countries to do their utmost to prevent the global temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by committing to reduce their carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other potential proposals to curb climate change that could come before Congress. Their prospects for adoption may depend on whether a proposal needs 51 votes (i.e., a party-line vote) or 60 votes (i.e., Republicans crossing party lines) in the Senate. For instance, tax breaks for wind energy, solar power, and electric vehicles and their recharging stations can be included in a &amp;ldquo;reconciliation bill,&amp;rdquo; which would require only 51 votes and is likely to pass as part of a long-term Biden agenda. By contrast, legislation regulating energy production would require 60 Senate votes and is less likely to gather the requisite bipartisan support, in our view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, that the U.S. has prioritised climate change and rejoined the Paris Agreement is important for the overall global commitment to the effort. Because such a powerful player had previously opted out, many countries were reluctant to take the tough steps to curb global warming, calculating that the global effort would fail. In essence, why make sacrifices if others don&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden entered the White House with a much larger mandate on climate than any of his predecessors as the issue has gradually garnered more support among Americans. According to a January 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults think protecting the environment should be a top priority for the president and Congress. This is up considerably since 2009 and the start of the Barack Obama administration, when the corresponding figure was 41 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fresh ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year will also see the UK host the COP26 summit in November, the most significant conference on climate change since COP21 in 2015, which led to the Paris accord. Accordingly, we expect to see an increase in policy commitments from national governments throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 125 countries that account for some 60 percent of total global emissions have already announced some target for &amp;ldquo;net-zero&amp;rdquo; emissions, which is seen as a key tool for meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement. This essentially means that any new carbon emissions will need to be offset by the removal of these gases already in the atmosphere&amp;mdash;by planting new forests, for example, or building out other emerging carbon capture technologies. In order to meet the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have calculated that the world would need to reach net zero for CO2 emissions by 2050, and for all greenhouse gas emissions sometime between 2063 and 2068. Greenhouse gas emissions include not only carbon dioxide, but also methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. This will require significant reductions in gross emissions, through conventional mitigation techniques such as the substitution of renewable energy for fossil fuels, as well as greater use of carbon removal technologies such as carbon capture and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that politicians are happy to set long-term targets, aiming to be at net-zero emissions in 2050, knowing they are unlikely to be running for re-election then, but they are very reluctant to make the necessary policy adjustments in the short term when the political cost could be high. For example, in the UK, fuel taxes have not been raised since 2011. Additionally, many countries&amp;rsquo; current commitments have not yet been signed into law, and remain just proposals. As a result, a number of forecasting models suggest that based on current national short-term carbon emission reduction goals, the average global temperature is on track to rise by as much as 3 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, includes a &amp;ldquo;ratchet mechanism&amp;rdquo; that requires the signatories to come forward with more ambitious short-term national climate goals every five years, taking into account the technological, economic, and social progress in the intervening years. This means some sort of convergence amongst net-zero commitments is likely at COP26, and for these to be formalised in each countries&amp;rsquo; individual climate action plan, known as &amp;ldquo;nationally determined contributions&amp;rdquo; (NDCs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect countries to announce new, enhanced NDCs at COP26 this November, and to flesh out their short-term plans in greater detail. This and the Biden presidency&amp;rsquo;s commitment to fight climate change should add momentum to the efforts to curb global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The cost of no action&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of climate change are well documented. From increased frequency of extreme weather events to rising sea levels and ocean acidification, the physical effects are potentially far-reaching. The climate-migration nexus will likely become a substantial challenge as well. The UN forecasts there could be anywhere between 25 million and 1 billion environmental migrants by 2050 as people are displaced due to intolerable heat effects on agriculture, or from rising sea levels inundating coastal areas where 40 percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these, there is also an economic toll. Studies conducted by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research have identified significant economic risks should global temperatures continue to climb. For the U.S., those risks range from a 10.5 percent decrease in GDP per capita if no action is taken worldwide to a nearly two percent decline even if the commitments in the Paris Agreement are met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now a growing consensus that a successful climate transition is necessary to build more resilient economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The need for government action &amp;hellip;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the solution is to decrease economies&amp;rsquo; reliance on carbon fuel. This requires the dual involvement of governments via policy support and regulation and the private sector with its capacity for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the activities that cause climate change are deeply ingrained in the foundations of our economies, governments need to ensure that mitigating measures are broad enough and sufficiently planned to be effective over the long term. Governments must also see that support is given to those industries that need to transform into greener propositions as well as to nascent green alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best examples of the effectiveness of government action to curb climate change is Germany&amp;rsquo;s solar energy subsidies. In the early 2000s, at a cost of some &amp;euro;200 billion over eight years, the German government guaranteed the price per megawatt hour sold from any installation at &amp;euro;457, about five times the cost of generating electricity from coal at that time. As other countries followed suit, the global market for solar panels expanded by more than 30 times, and the price of a solar panel fell to about a sixth of what it was in 2004 and has continued to decline ever since. In good weather conditions, new solar power installations can generate electricity at a lower cost than that generated from fossil fuels without needing subsidies to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the cost of wind power has dropped dramatically, powered by larger, more numerous installations worldwide and rapidly improving technology. Here too, government subsidies often provided the initial impetus. More will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&amp;hellip; enhanced by private sector innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector also needs to do its part given the 2050 targets are so ambitious. Only through innovation can they be hoped to be achieved. Much like the way personal computers revolutionised the world and our daily lives, and how new vaccines were developed in record time to help tame the COVID-19 pandemic, innovation is the key to solving our climate issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As RBC&amp;rsquo;s CEO Dave McKay remarked in his review of Davos 2021, &amp;ldquo;entire sectors will emerge&amp;mdash;or be remade&amp;mdash;through the 2020s as consumers look for technology to transform their lives, and governments spend trillions to lay the groundwork of a new economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is not alone. Larry Fink, founder of BlackRock, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest fund manager, urges CEOs in his annual letter to see climate transition as an opportunity&amp;mdash;but not just for the climate. He calculates the world will need $50 trillion in new investments by 2050 to meet the net-zero goals, creating new technologies and new industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With industry, buildings, and transport the top three producers of emissions, together accounting for close to 60 percent of the total, many innovations focus on reducing emissions in these areas. Well-known examples of technologies that could go a long way to decarbonising the world include the rapid growth of renewable energy supplies and electric vehicle manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also new technologies that are not quite mainstream yet, which show promise but need scale to help achieve a cooler planet. One is carbon capture and storage&amp;mdash;whereby carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes are seized, transported by ship or pipeline to a storage site, and deposited underground in geological formations. This technology could help industries achieve net-zero targets by offsetting emissions produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For buildings, one promising approach that dramatically cuts fossil fuel consumption uses geoexchange technology for heating and cooling. These systems are currently being used in Toronto to help new condos comply with the Toronto Green Standard, which calls for new buildings to have close to zero carbon emissions by 2030. Geoexchange draws heat and cooling from the ground, taking advantage of the earth&amp;rsquo;s constant temperature a few feet beneath the surface. In the winter, a fluid circulating through loops buried underground absorbs heat from the earth and brings it to the building. In the summer, the process is reversed. While the technology is expensive to install, it frees up valuable leasable space as bulky cooling towers, required for traditional heating/cooling systems, are no longer needed. That space can be used for penthouse suites or rooftop gardens. Some five percent of new condos in Toronto employ this new system, double the percentage of five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally thought that perhaps 75 percent of the energy produced by human endeavours is lost as waste heat. Mechanical means of recapturing lost energy from industrial processes have long existed. Carbon taxes and emission reduction targets have spurred renewed interest in these sorts of installations, while newer applications and technologies are expanding the potential for utilising this vast unused resource for non-industrial purposes&amp;mdash;e.g., data centres and commercial/residential buildings. Heating/cooling and power costs constitute the largest operating expense for most buildings. Increasingly, waste heat recapture installations are built and managed by third parties, often utilities, who sell the power back to buildings at attractive rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &amp;ldquo;Smart City&amp;rdquo; technologies are already being deployed in cities such as Singapore. They aim to ensure that every watt of energy is utilised as efficiently as possible at any given moment. Such processes optimise data management and involve the development and expansion of 5G technology, the fifth generation of broadband cellular networks, which can connect smart electric grids to billions of data points&amp;mdash;from rooftop solar panels to Internet of Things-based home appliances. Processing all this data, in conjunction with artificial intelligence-led local weather forecasts, can enhance efficient energy use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Investment implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change is a risk investors need to prudently consider, as it can, for example, imperil supply chains, or cause unexpected financial liabilities or losses. We pointed out in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""/us/en/research-insights/beyond-financial-statements-what-makes-a-company-sustainably-successful/detail/""&gt;a recent article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) analysis has an important role to play in risk mitigation. As Habib Subjally, head of the global equities team at RBC Global Asset Management, suggests, &amp;ldquo;[for many companies] ESG also drives important risk mitigation with respect to regulators, reputation, the stability of supply chains, etc. For example, a company that has developed an understanding of the potential impact of climate change on its end markets, suppliers, employees, and facilities&amp;mdash;and has a plan for dealing with it&amp;mdash;is, in our view, a less risky investment than one that hasn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond mitigating risks, there are opportunities. Investing in innovative technologies that have the potential to help decarbonise the environment and the economy can be done both at the stock level and through funds. At RBC, we refer to the combination of sustainability and technology as &amp;ldquo;SusTech,&amp;rdquo; and over the course of this year we will delve more deeply into this theme, looking in some detail at solution providers for the green economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in solution providers, those companies that develop products and services to be used to adapt to or mitigate climate change are interesting investment opportunities in their own right and are perhaps the most direct way for a portfolio to gain exposure to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of his 28-day journey was to bring awareness to the challenges many soldiers face when they return from service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Smith&amp;#39;s determination to raise awareness, veteran-focused nonprofit GallantFew established the Patriot Challenge, an annual fitness fundraiser that supports veteran organizations across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and teams raise money by logging at least 565 total miles during the 28 days of February. How participants complete their miles widely varies. Athletes can run, bike, swim or skate, and they also earn a mile for every 15 minutes of non-distance-related activity, such as weight lifting, yoga or CrossFit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Patriot Challenge raised a record $466,000, an $80,000 increase over the previous year despite having 1,600 fewer participants. And social distancing restrictions led challengers to find creative ways to log their miles, including cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and walking their dogs.&amp;nbsp;In all, participants logged a total of 288,639 miles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I tracked a lot of my miles on my basement elliptical machine, but on the weekends I tried to get outdoors,&amp;rdquo; says Mark Gorius, an operations director for RBC Wealth Management. Gorius, an Army veteran, is chair of the firm&amp;#39;s veterans-focused employee resource group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Beasts of the East,&amp;rdquo; a 38-member team based in the Baltimore area, tracked the most miles for RBC Wealth Management, logging 4,005 miles and raising nearly $21,000. Of the 277 teams nationwide that participated in the challenge, the &amp;rdquo;Beasts of the East&amp;rdquo; ranked fifth for money raised and 14th for total mileage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;I am so proud of RBC Wealth Management employees&amp;#39; efforts in raising money and logging miles for the Patriot Challenge,&amp;rdquo; says Pat Vaughan, East Division director at RBC Wealth Management and executive sponsor of the veterans-focused employee resource group. &amp;ldquo;We started with a goal of raising $5,000 and surpassed that within the first week. When you work together, you can make a difference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

".org",".org","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","The re-imagined bucket list: How to finance your dreams","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;Popularized in the film, &lt;em&gt;The Bucket List&lt;/em&gt;, a list of dreams to fulfill before you die often is associated with retirement or the end of life. In the movie, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman portray two&amp;nbsp;seniors diagnosed with cancer who embark on an around-the-world trip, coming to some realizations about the meaning of life along the way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty common that a person has a health scare or someone they know passed away, and that&amp;rsquo;s when they start thinking about these issues,&amp;rdquo; says Daniel Sullivan, wealth strategist for RBC Wealth Management-U.S. &amp;ldquo;They realize time is short.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly half (46 percent) of Baby Boomers - people age 53-71 - have some type of a bucket list, according to the AARP. The majority of items on those lists revolve around travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But bucket lists have become more than places to see or things to do. They&amp;rsquo;ve evolved into life mission statements or personal manifestos of goals you want to accomplish during your lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s often because today, retirement is defined differently for many people. Some people may retire earlier than ever, while others must keep working longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most clients I see are enjoying their life rather than waiting for retirement to check off boxes as to what they want to do,&amp;rdquo; says Liz Jacovino, a wealth strategist for RBC Wealth Management-U.S. &amp;ldquo;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the new retirement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what age you are, everyone should have a list of goals. In a practical sense, it provides focus. On a deeper level, a bucket list or life manifesto provides hope and a sense of accomplishment that can be life-affirming and enhance our sense of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five tips to making your dreams become reality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. How to start&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to set aside some time to think about your life and accomplishments. On a notepad, laptop or tablet, write down all of your dreams. Nothing is too big or too small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, many people want to ensure they&amp;rsquo;ll have enough money to take care of themselves and their spouse in retirement, says Sullivan. To help estimate that amount, which depends on individual needs and lifestyles, Sullivan will ask clients how they envision retirement and what they want to do in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask tougher and more specific questions: Do you want to buy a sports car? Do you want to travel? What do you want your legacy to be? Do you want to establish an alumni scholarship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients&amp;rsquo; answers to these questions often become items on their retirement bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. Where to find inspiration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for inspiration,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://bucketlist.org/""&gt;Bucketlist.org&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start. You can explore over five million ideas posted on the free site by over 400,000 people - and create and track goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find ideas in plenty of other places, too. Check out magazines and internet &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; lists, such as best small towns in America, and books with titles like &lt;em&gt;1,000 Places to See Before You Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bucket lists often are travel-heavy. People want to see beautiful places and experience different cultures nationwide and worldwide. Travel destinations common on bucket lists include the Grand Canyon, Great Wall of China and Great Pyramids of Egypt. You get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to AARP, 83 percent of Baby Boomers with a bucket list have travel-related items on it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While people age 33-71 say a travel list gives them something to look forward to, hope and motivation, more Millennials (24 percent) say their travel list pushes them to experience new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bucket lists, however, can be much more than travel itineraries. RBC professionals say some clients&amp;rsquo; goals include buying a vacation home to spend more time with children and grandchildren who live in another state or establishing a &lt;span&gt;charitable trust&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;donor advised fund&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;private foundation&lt;/span&gt; to address their philanthropic goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also include professional goals, such as starting a business, and activities, such as running a marathon or learning a second language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Organizing your list&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time to break up your long list into digestible chunks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can separate your goals by category: travel, professional, educational, etc. Another way is to sort the list by time &amp;ndash; goals by year or season or goals to reach before you turn 40, 50 or 60.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur Steve Kamb created a game, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.nerdfitness.com/epic-quest/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Epic Quest of Awesome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, from his bucket list, which he carved into 13 categories including travel, personal goals and James Bond goals.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, prioritize each category. Ask yourself which goal is most important, what excites you the most or which goal can you easily accomplish. The answers may change over time, so keep your list updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4. Achieving your goals&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of your goals need to be lofty. Make some smaller and easily reachable, which will also increase your satisfaction level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take blogger and author &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=""https://bucketlistjourney.net/about/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Annette White&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 1,000-item life mission statement. The giant list includes 84 UNESCO World Heritage sites, but also many smaller goals, such as make a snowman, shuck oysters and design a website.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can plan how to reach your first goal. When should you do it? What are the logistics? Do you want to do it alone or with someone?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a step process. Say you want to visit the Coliseum in Rome. First, get or update your passport. Second, learn Italian. Third, fly to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5. Making your list real&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it all seems too abstract, document your journey. Several free mobile apps, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.iwishbucketlist.com/"" target=""_blank""&gt;iWish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Apple and Android devices, let you explore ideas and create, track and share your bucket list.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write about your achievements in a journal, create a map to mark places you visit or blog about your experiences. Make it fun for you, your family and friends to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

They&amp;#39;ve planned. They&amp;#39;ve saved. And they thought once they left the workforce, they&amp;#39;d be able to make those dreams a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, with wildfires, severe drought and hurricanes increasing in frequency, some are giving up on those reveries, choosing instead to&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;live out retirement closer to home&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and save the cash they would have otherwise spent for other wishes and wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example a couple that RBC Wealth Management adviser Kim Shappee has worked with for more than a decade. They&amp;#39;d been planning to buy a retirement home in the Florida Keys. For the past five years, on Shappee&amp;#39;s advice, they&amp;#39;ve spent one month a year visiting various parts of the area to settle on their favorite spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time they spent researching on-site each year confirmed their decision to retire there&amp;mdash;until last winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hurricane hit during their stay, giving them an up-close look at what life in The Keys during severe weather might be like. Once they began to look at the data on storm frequency, they realized that while they&amp;#39;d been lucky with good weather the four years prior, the prognosis for the future wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily good. So they changed their mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d already entered into a purchase agreement on a home there, so the pivot cost them money, but not as much as they thought they might spend long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because erratic weather patterns are not only worrisome from a safety standpoint&amp;mdash;they can be financially costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent article in&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coastal Heritage Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;noted that the cost of homeowners&amp;#39; insurance, including wind coverage, is increasing significantly in hurricane-prone areas. In fact,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;climate change&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;will add $183 billion to annual premiums for property insurance by 2040, according to research by the reinsurance group, Swiss Re Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some insurers, premium hikes aren&amp;#39;t even enough to make the risk profitable.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coastal Heritage Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;found that in 18 states along the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic seaboard, many major insurers are in retreat, selling fewer policies or not renewing them at all. Meanwhile, in California, where 2017 and 2018 went down as the state&amp;#39;s worst two years for fire on record, insurers paid $24 billion in claims. Today, in an effort to limit their exposure and losses, some insurers are refusing to renew home policies there, declining 350,000 renewals over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wealth managers responsible for helping clients not only preserve but protect their wealth, we must take these risks into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exorbitant insurance premiums may be doable for some ultra-high-net-worth families, but even for families of means, they come at the expense of other important things like&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;long-term-care insurance&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;or leaving a financial legacy for children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why understanding the potential impact of climate change on clients&amp;#39; retirement plans and helping to guide and coach pursuant to those risks is absolutely critical for advisers doing business today and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Asking tough questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released in Aug. 2021 showed that the planet&amp;#39;s average temperature has risen about two degrees Fahrenheit in the last 120 years. This has led to mean sea levels rising seven inches between 1901 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report states that these changes are contributing to weather extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts and tropical cyclones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBC, as an enterprise, acknowledges that climate change affects all communities and sectors of the economy. In 2019, the company released its&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""http://www.rbc.com/community-sustainability/_assets-custom/pdf/RBC-Environmental-Blueprint.pdf"" target=""_blank""&gt;Climate Blueprint&lt;/a&gt;, which is our enterprise strategy to accelerate clean economic growth and support our clients in a socially inclusive transition to net-zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is important work at a macro level, in our wealth management business, it&amp;#39;s imperative we address these risks with clients on a micro level. We help clients evaluate the risks of the area they want to live by asking pointed questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What climate risks are there in the area I am looking to move to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Can I insure against the risks present in the area I&amp;#39;m looking to move to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Will I be able to sell my property in the climate risk area if I buy it now?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If I buy a destination retirement home, what will the resale value be for my heirs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, there are tools available to help answer these important questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.americancommunities.org/mapping-climate-risks-by-county-and-community/"" target=""_blank""&gt;The American Communities Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;offers a climate risk mapping tool to determine what regions&amp;#39; populations and infrastructure may be especially vulnerable. Climate Check also offers a tool that allows you to look at risks or the specific address or ZIP Code a client is looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also imperative that people seeking to purchase property in a flood- or hurricane-prone area or in regions where wildfires are becoming more frequent speak first to a property and casualty insurer to see whether they can even purchase a policy to protect their new asset and if so, at what cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisers must become as familiar with these tools as they are with 401(k) savings projection calculators and estate planning laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When risk outweighs reward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, counties with the largest share of homes facing high heat, drought, fire, flood and storm risk saw their populations increase due to net migration over the last five years while areas with lower climate risk saw their populations decline, according to Redfin. This is largely due, they say, to the lower costs and the attractiveness of the area they are moving to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areas with significant risk are also areas with a high level of retirees moving to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might be changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, an April 2021 survey from Redfin found that about half of respondents who plan to move in the next year said extreme temperatures and/or the increasing frequency or intensity of natural disasters played a role in their decision to relocate. More than a third (36 percent) said rising sea levels were a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investors not considering these factors, it&amp;#39;s important that advisers highlight both the climate cost and risk when clients are making a decision as to where to retire because as with any investment, it&amp;#39;s our job to point out that what they save today&amp;mdash;they might spend in spades later.&lt;/p&gt;

".org",".org","","Insights Articles (blog posts)","MARKETING","Collaborative philanthropy: How the next generation is teaming up to create lasting change","en_US","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content><value>&lt;p&gt;A new generation of passionate changemakers are hoping to take collaborative philanthropy to the next level in an increasingly interconnected world to solve some of the planet&amp;#39;s most pressing issues. With more like-minded philanthropists, more resources and a burgeoning number of charitable collaborations, this new generation of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) is not content with simply putting money toward causes they believe in&amp;mdash;they want to make sure their efforts have enduring impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re a generation influenced by&amp;nbsp;globalization, who worry about the kind of world their children will grow up in. As a result, they&amp;#39;re more often socially and environmentally conscious: 93 percent of them donate to philanthropic causes, according to new research from RBC, along with Campden Wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They &amp;ldquo;want their children to learn values of not only hard work and an understanding of the value of money, but also tolerance and respect for others, along with a sense of social and environmental responsibility,&amp;rdquo; the report says, adding that more than half of those surveyed believe these are important lessons to learn at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Shaping tomorrow, today&amp;nbsp;report surveyed over 100 next-generation wealth holders from Canada, the United States and the UK. The report found that in the last 12 months alone, 84 percent gave as much as US$1 million of their personal wealth to charitable causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But top of mind for more than a third of respondents is making sure their money is put to good use and measuring its impact. Nearly a quarter say one of the biggest challenges of giving is identifying the right organizations to support, while 11 and 10 percent say the greatest challenge is finding co-investing partners and scaling up, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Teaming up to have a greater impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philanthropy done well is always collaborative to some degree, says Valerie Chort, vice president of Corporate Citizenship at RBC and executive director of RBC Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, it&amp;#39;s about making an impact around a common cause&amp;mdash;often addressing a systemic challenge&amp;mdash;as a group, typically pairing investors with nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Fell, who heads global ultra-high-net-worth services at RBC, says philanthropists involved in this kind of work recognize they can do better and do more by working with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s arguably more mature philanthropy, more sophisticated,&amp;rdquo; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s a significant sign of experience, maturity&amp;mdash;just a little bit more sophistication. There&amp;#39;s less ego involved,&amp;rdquo; says Fell, who is also the board chair for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.princestrust.ca/about-us/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Prince&amp;#39;s Trust Canada&lt;/a&gt;, part of a global charity established by the Prince of Wales that focuses on empowering youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the most ordinary person, it&amp;#39;s recognition that by giving together, one and one can make three.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBC Foundation&amp;#39;s Chort says it&amp;#39;s not necessarily just about how much money one puts towards a cause, but what they can bring to the table in other ways too. This is something the next generation of UHNW philanthropists recognize, according to the RBC report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Generation X from the U.S. explained in an interview for the report, &amp;ldquo;The previous generation really saw investments as investments, and charity as writing a cheque. So I&amp;#39;m in the process of thinking more about how to use our financial background to leverage our giving, versus just one extreme (philanthropy) or the other (investing).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, experienced philanthropists understand that even a billion-dollar investment in a charitable cause can be multiplied when they team up with others. Partnering with governments, the private sector, as well as other non-governmental organizations, for example, can bring scale, reputational growth and many other advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://givingpledge.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;The Giving Pledge&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2010, has served as a strong road map for UHNW families when collaborating with others on large scale, high-impact philanthropy. As of May 2019, the pledge had 204 signatories from 22 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trying to tackle some of the world&amp;#39;s most challenging problems, which have been magnified by the COVID crisis, becomes much more complex and challenging than one single philanthropist can do on their own,&amp;rdquo; says Robyn Calder, executive director of The ELMA Philanthropies and a member of the RBC Philanthropy Advisory Council. It&amp;#39;s even more critical now, she says, to engage with others to create social change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The key to successful collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it&amp;#39;s not enough to simply pool money with others. &amp;ldquo;You need to embark around a passion that ignites you as a person,&amp;rdquo; Fell says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just over half of those surveyed say they support education and academic research. This is followed by youth and children (34 percent) and almost a third believe in helping fund arts, culture and sports, as well as community development. Nearly a quarter of those surveyed support health initiatives and just over one-fifth support environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, animal rights and food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that passion is identified, it&amp;#39;s also important to understand the initiative and its mission in order to ensure there&amp;#39;s strong, effective governance associated with it. Due diligence is also required to ensure everyone is aligned and shares the same values around the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions to ask include: how much do they know about the issue? Are they well-versed or are they just getting started? What can they bring to the cause? Is it money or entrepreneurial experience? How well do you know the ecosystem for the issue you want to support? How is&amp;nbsp;impact measured and tracked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In order to have collaborative philanthropy ... you want to bring the best partners together to be able to solve that issue together,&amp;rdquo; says Chort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a group wants to find solutions to homelessness, for example, they need to engage policy makers, people who deal with homelessness on the streets, experts in real estate &amp;mdash;different parts of the ecosystem, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s bringing together individuals who care about the same issue, pooling their money and expertise to achieve something greater than themselves, Chort explains, but she cautions: &amp;ldquo;Understanding the power dynamics is really important, so you can actually achieve collaboration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Chort says funders bringing in the money need to understand their role so they don&amp;#39;t inadvertently impose a direction or a view that may not necessarily be the best approach for a given situation&amp;mdash;that&amp;#39;s not collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What does collaborative philanthropy look like today?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://skoll.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;The Skoll Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Canadian billionaire Jeffrey Skoll, invests in individuals or groups whose goals are to try and solve some of the world&amp;#39;s most pressing social, cultural and environmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ambitious funds include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.bluemeridian.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Blue Meridian Partners&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on strategies that can make the greatest difference in lifting families and young people out of poverty in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.co-impact.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Co-Impact&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes itself as a global philanthropic collaborative that brings together local communities, nonprofits, governments, donors and many others to solve social problems on a large scale. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://end.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;END Fund&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;collaborates with governments, NGOs, drug companies, academic partners and others to tackle neglected tropical diseases that affect more than 1.7 billion people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=""link-ext"" href=""https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/"" target=""_blank""&gt;the Great Reset&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in direct response to COVID-19 and the political, economic and social upheaval it&amp;#39;s caused. Fell says the pandemic has brought inequities to the forefront and a heightened sense of urgency for many philanthropists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Especially as a result of the pandemic, there&amp;#39;s certainly an emergence of people who want to partner with others to address change,&amp;rdquo; Fell says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;#39;s much more to come here and we&amp;#39;re just at the forefront of seeing a surge in thinking around collaborative philanthropy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to use that time to give back to her&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;community, she sought out opportunities to get involved with area nonprofit organizations. With a personal interest in education, camping and the outdoors, and as a former Girl Scout leader, she found just what she was looking for in &lt;a class=""link-icon"" href=""https://campfiremn.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Camp Fire Minnesota&lt;rbc-icon icon=""external-link"" label=""Open in new window""&gt;&lt;/rbc-icon&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;one of the nation&amp;#39;s longest-running youth development organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Camp Fire Minnesota really focuses on helping youth find their spark through nature,&amp;quot; says Buchert, the chief administrative officer of RBC Wealth Management-U.S. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all about environmental education and helping kids get out into nature who don&amp;#39;t otherwise have the opportunity to do so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, Buchert joined Camp Fire Minnesota&amp;#39;s Board of Directors. As a board member, she uses her time and resources&amp;mdash;including the funding and employee volunteers from RBC Wealth Management&amp;mdash;to help support Camp Fire Minnesota&amp;#39;s mission of connecting thousands of youth each year with nature-based experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Being a board member is more than just the formal board meetings or fundraisers&amp;mdash;it&amp;#39;s also doing what I can when I see a need, or thinking of other ways to help,&amp;quot; Buchert says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s fulfilling to be involved and to see what it means to kids who get to experience nature through Camp Fire&amp;#39;s programs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buchert is one of seven RBC Wealth Management executives who serve on the boards of Twin Cities-area nonprofits. Through that involvement with organizations focused on community health, education, the arts and more, those executives help lead the way when it comes to RBC Wealth Management&amp;#39;s culture of giving back and supporting local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using a personal experience to help others&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Wally Chapman, director of RBC Wealth Management&amp;#39;s central division, board service is personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago,&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Chapman&amp;#39;s father was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, the second most common form of degenerative dementia after Alzheimer&amp;#39;s. As he and his family set out on the difficult path of understanding the disease and doing what they could to help his father, Chapman was introduced to the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-icon"" href=""https://www.alz.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association&lt;rbc-icon icon=""external-link"" label=""Open in new window""&gt;&lt;/rbc-icon&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;at a local fundraiser. After learning about how the organization strives to end Alzheimer&amp;#39;s and other dementia while helping affected families like his own, he found himself wanting to get more involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2021, he joined the board of the Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association&amp;#39;s Minnesota-North Dakota Chapter and also serves with his wife Eva as co-chair of the chapter&amp;#39;s 2022 fundraising gala. Like Buchert, during his first few months in the role, he&amp;#39;s worked to help the organization in any way he can, whether through his personal resources or those of RBC Wealth Management. One of his focuses has been increasing RBC&amp;#39;s presence and involvement at local fundraisers, including at the annual Twin Cities Walk to End Alzheimer&amp;#39;s in September, where RBC Wealth Management raised $15,000 out of a nearly $1 million fundraising total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=""Wally chapman"" class=""img-fluid mb-1-half"" src=""/documents/10192/0/wally-chapman.jpg/d2c1bcf5-1b84-476b-9ee8-00c63e544d53?t=1645107706949"" style=""width: 100%; height: 100%;"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""footnote""&gt;Wally Chapman, second from right, at a recent Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association fundraising event with RBC Wealth Management colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Chapman isn&amp;#39;t the only board member to have been impacted personally by the disease, he sees a lot of value in his ability to draw from his personal experience and previous interactions with the Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope I can be a better board member because I&amp;#39;ve seen firsthand the experience of this disease and the positive impact the Association can have on families,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve had people that I&amp;#39;ve met come around and support me, so my hope is, through the things that I learn and the people that I meet on the board, that I could be that support for somebody going through it in the future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he becomes more comfortable in the role, he also hopes to be able to use the Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association&amp;#39;s many resources to help train RBC Wealth Management&amp;#39;s financial advisors on how they can help families dealing with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I believe that RBC owes it to our advisors to try and help them be better resources for clients and their families who are affected by Alzheimer&amp;#39;s or dementia,&amp;quot; Chapman says, &amp;quot;to know enough that we can be an advocate and help them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An opportunity to make a difference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vikesh Nemani would be the first to admit that, until recently, he didn&amp;#39;t know much about the arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite that lack of familiarity, in March 2021 Nemani joined the board of the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=""link-icon"" href=""https://walkerart.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Walker Art Center&lt;rbc-icon icon=""external-link"" label=""Open in new window""&gt;&lt;/rbc-icon&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in Minneapolis, a museum known for its innovative presentations and acclaimed collections of contemporary art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nemani, the head of strategy for RBC Wealth Management, serves on the organization&amp;#39;s art acquisition, compensation and finance committees, and has been involved with the creation of the Walker&amp;#39;s five-year strategic plan. Through all of that, he&amp;#39;s found himself more involved than he expected to be, usually at least a couple of hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=""vikesh nemani gala"" class=""img-fluid mb-1-half"" src=""/documents/10192/0/vikesh-nemani-gala.jpg/add33be5-ace8-4c64-b210-1bdc1cfb3d4b?t=1645107783569"" style=""width: 100%; height: 100%;"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""footnote""&gt;Vikesh Nemani, far left, at a Walker Art Center fundraising event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And despite not having any prior involvement with the arts, Nemani has been able to bring his finance background to help the Walker find new ways to grow revenue and increase spending in order to develop the art center&amp;#39;s brand and reputation internationally, despite the continued challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Especially on the compensation and finance committees, and in working on the strategic plan, those are my strengths, so I feel like I have the opportunity to help make a difference for a very recognizable institution in this community,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, like Buchert with Camp Fire Minnesota and Chapman with the Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Association, he doesn&amp;#39;t see his board member role as simply a one-way street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I get more out of this than what I&amp;#39;m giving to it,&amp;quot; Nemani says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been really rewarding for me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

On one important front&amp;mdash;the fight against global warming&amp;mdash;most countries will have tried to reach &amp;ldquo;net zero,&amp;rdquo; a state where the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) added to the atmosphere is balanced out by that removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explore some of the most eye-catching changes our children and grandchildren are likely to experience in key areas of their lives. After assessing the difficulties in achieving net zero, we review some investment implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does net zero really mean?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;net zero&amp;rdquo; carries within it the message that even if all efforts are made to reduce human-produced carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases, if renewables replace coal and other fossil fuels, and even if green hydrogen is scaled up massively, certain sectors for which these solutions are somewhat impractical, such as aviation or farming, will still produce carbon emissions. Emissions that can&amp;rsquo;t otherwise be avoided will need to be removed from the atmosphere via solutions such as direct air capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or by nature-based solutions, for example, tree planting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;reductions needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;This action aims to help cap the rise in the global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=""footnote""&gt;Note: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;reductions necessary if mitigation had started&amp;mdash;with global emissions peaking and quickly reducing&amp;mdash;in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""disclaimer""&gt;Source - OurWorldinData.org&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of global warming is proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide that is added to the atmosphere. Thus, to stabilize climate change, net GHG emissions need to fall to zero, i.e., net zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression comes from an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 that called for capping the warming of the planet to below 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average temperature in an attempt to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, such as (even more) extreme weather and potentially disastrous increases in sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving this will be no small feat as temperatures today are already one degree Celsius above the pre-industrial level and continue to climb, driven by 51 billion metric tons of GHGs emitted worldwide each year. To achieve the temperature goal, the IPCC estimated that global carbon dioxide emissions must fall by about 45 percent by 2030 and to net zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries and regional blocs, including the U.S., UK, and the European Union (EU), have committed to reach net zero by 2050; China targets 2060. Some nations have made the commitment legally binding. Meanwhile, many businesses have declared their intentions to meet this goal by mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The future increase in the global average temperature will depend on the reduction in GHG emissions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A net-zero world by mid-century&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our descendants will live in a world that will be a very different place to how it is today, with wholesale changes in their homes, modes of transport, and the landscape that surrounds them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Decarbonized homes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homes will likely receive 95 percent of their electricity from wind and solar versus some 40 percent in 2020. Most fossil fuel-powered furnaces and boilers will very likely be replaced by heat pumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat pumps are devices powered by electricity that extract heat from the air or ground to warm a fluid that is compressed to boost the temperature. In effect, they operate like a refrigerator in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the technology has been in use for some time, there are impediments to scaling it up. Heat pumps are refrigerator-sized, while installation can be costly and disruptive. Still, nearly 20 million households purchased heat pumps in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), meeting five percent of global home heating demand. The IEA estimates this share needs to triple by 2030 to meet net-zero goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is needed to reduce the size of the units while offering a cooling option as well as heating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy support will also be needed to speed up adoption of this new technology. In the UK, from 2025, gas-fired boilers will be banned in newly built homes, while the installation of new replacement gas boilers in existing houses will be prohibited by the mid-2030s. To encourage the use of heat pumps, the UK government is offering a number of grants to households.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebuilding may also see big changes. Either the key raw materials used today, steel and cement, will be processed differently, or substitutes will have to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steel and cement industries are massive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;emitters, each accounting for roughly seven percent of total global emissions, according to the IEA. &amp;ldquo;Greening&amp;rdquo; these heavy industries will be important to achieve net zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several emerging technologies, which are close derivatives of well-understood and commercial processes used today, could yield significant emissions reductions in the medium term. In the steel industry, pilot programs are using hydrogen to complement or replace coal in the high-temperature combustion process. Meanwhile, feasibility studies suggest the use of hydrogen could substantially reduce the amount of carbon that is emitted from a cement kiln. At the same time, it appears mixing carbon dioxide with the water used to cure concrete can add usefully to its strength, meaning less cement can be used while simultaneously locking away the carbon in the concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineered timber frames for buildings are another innovation that will increasingly be used to replace steel and cement. Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is produced by gluing planks of wood together, layering the grain of the wood at right angles. CLT was first used in a high-rise building in Vancouver in 2017, and other skyscrapers have made use of it since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Window panes could even be made of wood. Swedish scientists found ways to extract pigments from wood, resulting in a transparent material that can be used much like glass but weighing less and insulating more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, roofs will increasingly be covered by solar panels or vegetation to provide a natural form of insulation and reduce energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Transformed transport&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s widely expected that electric vehicles (EV) will be ubiquitous, but their capabilities will likely be far more efficient than today&amp;rsquo;s models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, an EV that is not in use may feed energy back to the grid via two-way charging points. In this way EVs can act as an aggregated megabattery, helping the grid offset the inevitable vagaries of wind and solar power. After all, cars are idle most of the time and a large amount of battery power is unutilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also likely that wireless charging technology will dramatically evolve, both with respect to home wireless chargers as well as the possibility of charging an EV battery even as the vehicle is being driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While electric trains have been around for decades, diesel engines remain the most pervasive power source and are ripe for replacement. South Korea already operates electric multiple unit trains, and it intends to phase out all of its diesel passenger trains by 2029. French manufacturer Alstom is running a hydrogen-powered passenger train service in Europe, which it expects to roll out more widely over the next several years. Meanwhile, Canadian Pacific Railway has put eight hydrogen-powered freight locomotives into service to assess their viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aviation, electric airplanes are not yet practical due to the huge on-board weight of batteries. Late in 2020, Airbus announced that hydrogen-fueled propulsion systems would be central to a new generation of zero-emissions commercial aircraft. The project is a flagship of the EU&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 stimulus package that aims to green the bloc&amp;rsquo;s economy. Airbus believes its planes could be ready by 2035, though whether their use becomes commonplace will depend on&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;hydrogen&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;being produced at scale and without a large carbon footprint, challenges in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Reshaped landscape&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape of 2050 will be different beyond simply the further proliferation of wind turbines and solar panels, which have already become prevalent over the years. In cities, more green spaces to lock up CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;will be widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With homes receiving the majority of their electricity from wind and solar and a greater amount of electricity generation directed at transport, more transmission infrastructure, including pylons and substations, will be needed to carry energy to homes and factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelers may see tram-style overhead power cables hovering above a truck lane on the highway&amp;mdash;the electric motorway. Trucks emit between 15 percent and 18 percent of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;emissions and German conglomerate Siemens has been at the forefront of an innovative technology to reduce this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens&amp;rsquo; first &amp;ldquo;eHighway&amp;rdquo; was piloted in Sweden, with diesel hybrid vehicles manufactured by Scania adapted to operate with power from an overhead contact line. A similar system was also tested in Los Angeles. The UK government commissioned a study in 2021 to assess the economic and technical potential of a national rollout of this technology, which offers many advantages beyond cutting emissions and improving air quality. It can eliminate the dependency on battery range performance while increasing utilization rates as it would eliminate idle time during charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, given that a massive reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere will be necessary, direct air capture (DAC) facilities, which extract CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;directly from the air, are likely to be built on the edge of urban areas. These will look like rows of boxes containing fans humming away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC suggests that to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, around 730 billion metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;must be taken out of the atmosphere by the end of this century in addition to a significant reduction in emissions. That is equivalent to all the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;emitted by the U.S., the UK, and China since 1750.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAC removes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;from the atmosphere by forcing air over a chemical that grabs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then compresses, transfers, and stores it in deep geological formations. Currently, 19 DAC plants are in operation worldwide, capturing 10,000 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is cost. The largest DAC facility operating today, in Iceland and operated by ClimeWorks, a Swiss firm, can remove 4,000 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;from the air per year and store it in mineral form at a cost of $600 to $800 per metric ton. Scaling up the technology can bring the price down. Canada&amp;rsquo;s Carbon Engineering believes its much larger plant with planned capacity of one million metric tons per year, scheduled to open in three years&amp;rsquo; time in Texas, can operate at a much lower cost, in a range of $90 to $240 per metric ton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Carbon Engineering, DAC technology combined with secure geological storage can deliver permanent and verifiable removal of carbon dioxide from the air, reversing the emissions process, and provide sectors struggling to decarbonize, such as aviation, shipping, and oil and gas, with a potential path to achieve net-zero targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach net zero by 2050, DAC will need to be scaled up to capture more than 85 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;per year by 2030 and approximately 980 million metric tons per year by 2050, according to the IEA. To put the level of infrastructure in place to realize these goals will require targeted government support including grants and public procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cheaper option to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is planting trees, and reforestation efforts have increased in recent years. The IPCC suggests that increasing the total area of the world&amp;rsquo;s forests, woodlands, and woody savannahs could store around one-quarter of the atmospheric carbon necessary to limit the rise in the global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius&amp;mdash;though this would require adding up to 24 million hectares of forest (roughly the size of the U.S. state of Oregon) every year from now until 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent national reforestation efforts are nowhere near that level, despite several countries having announced ambitious plans. But people in 2050 are nevertheless likely to see more woodland areas. Encouragingly, the shift toward plant-based diets may free up to 20 percent of farmland for other uses, according to the UK&amp;rsquo;s Climate Change Committee, a statutory body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planting trees may be cost-effective but it may not be the most efficient method to pull CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;from the air, given how large reforestation areas have to be in order to make a difference. Moreover, trees can burn in wildfires or be cut down, causing much of the stored carbon to be released. Simply, reforestation cannot reduce emissions on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Some industries set to benefit from the energy transition&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;A wide range of industries are working toward achieving the greening of the economy&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can net zero ever be achieved?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving net zero is a huge task with enormous challenges, as we described in a recent article on the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;green energy transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these is the hefty price tag. A 2019 World Bank estimate suggested the necessary global infrastructure investment would cost $90 trillion. Spread over 30 years, this would amount to about 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent of GDP per annum, which is manageable, in our view. Moreover, the same study also estimated that the investment could be recouped four times over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the cost of inaction could very well be higher than the investment needed. Reinsurer Swiss Re recently estimated that the global economy could be seven percent to 10 percent smaller in 2050 than now as a result of the cost of climate change (including the damage from extreme weather), as well as parts of the planet becoming uninhabitable, fueling hunger and migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the solutions for countries to achieve net zero do exist, or are in early development, many need to be scaled up, a process that is capital intensive and fraught with difficulties. It is an encouraging sign that at the recent UN climate summit, COP26, not only did nations pledge to meet net-zero targets by 2050, but so did more than 5,000 businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, just as the uptake of both solar and wind energy over the past two decades was encouraged by policy support, such as tax credits, subsidies, and government-backed loans, the same approach and resolve will be needed to help these technologies become commercialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pragmatism should prevail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For investors, this represents both risks and opportunities. Our view is that investors should maintain a pragmatic approach given the serious gaps between net-zero ambitions and potential outcomes. High-emissions companies that do not adapt are likely to incur difficulties. Those that adapt or develop new technologies, if given support to reach commercialization, will likely find themselves in a position to benefit from this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

The truth is, fraudsters are increasingly&amp;nbsp;sophisticated,&amp;nbsp;finding bold new ways to take advantage of even the most internet savvy Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent&amp;nbsp;bulletin&amp;nbsp;from the Federal Bureau of Investigation told the story of a Texas woman and an online romance that rapidly devolved into a multi-million&amp;nbsp;dollar heartache. The woman, in her 50s, was active on email and Facebook when she developed an online friendship and later, a romance with a man named &amp;quot;Charlie&amp;quot; who claimed to work in construction. As her unraveling marriage pushed her closer to her new online friend, she placed her trust in him, wiring increasingly large sums of money to &amp;ldquo;help him finish&amp;quot; a construction job in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thought about it long and hard. I prayed about it. I&amp;#39;ve always been a very giving person, and I figured if I had money &amp;hellip; I could send him some [money]. And he promised to have it back within 24 to 48 hours. I thought, &amp;#39;I could do that.&amp;#39; It was kind of a statement of faith, too,&amp;quot; she told the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t return the money and hiding behind the anonymity of his online personality and excuses that kept the pair from meeting in person, &amp;ldquo;Charlie&amp;quot; took $2 million from the woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Internet makes this type of crime easy because you can pretend to be anybody you want to be. You can be anywhere in the world and victimize people,&amp;quot; Special Agent Christine Beining, a veteran financial fraud investigator in the FBI&amp;#39;s Houston Division said in the article. &amp;ldquo;The perpetrators will reach out to a lot of people on various networking sites to find somebody who may be a good target. Then they use what the victims have on their profile pages and try to work those relationships and see which ones develop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FBI&amp;#39;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), romance scams &amp;ndash; also called confidence fraud &amp;ndash; are responsible for the highest amount of financial losses compared to other online crime. IC3 received 15,000 reports of confidence fraud in 2016 (nearly 2,500 more than the previous year) accounting for more than $230 million in losses. Overall, the IC3 received 298,728 complaints resulting in a total victim loss of $1.33 billion, and the 30- to 39-year-old category had the highest number of victims next to the over 60 category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet scams are a costly affair and can affect anyone, but there are ways to insulate yourself against digital deception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Knowing when you don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to combat scams is to make time to review bulletins and &amp;ldquo;top 10&amp;nbsp;scam&amp;quot; lists put out by groups like IC3, the NCOA, or&amp;nbsp;your financial institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, fraudsters have turned to tech support scams, where legitimate-looking pop-ups appear on your computer screen offering support or calls from scammers claiming they work for a reputable computer company asking for your banking information to &amp;ldquo;update your computer software.&amp;quot; Con artists might also pose as members of the IRS,&amp;nbsp;asking&amp;nbsp;you to confirm your tax information via email or worse, masquerade as collectors looking for funds to settle tax disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is also a mainline for fraudsters: free trip offers, sweepstakes, charities, discounted medicine, &amp;ldquo;official sounding&amp;quot; emails from your bank or utility provider &amp;ndash; con artists treat email like a fishing line, casting out emails into cyberspace and waiting for bites. The key to navigating these types of scams is to know when you don&amp;#39;t know for sure who is on the other end of the email. Don&amp;#39;t open any links from unidentified sources; if the email seems like it&amp;#39;s coming from an official source, call and confirm in person using the number you have in your own records, not the one supplied in the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Watch for red flags&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be fraud aware; situations that seem like they&amp;#39;re &amp;ldquo;too good to be true&amp;quot; probably are. Investment fraud is a prime example. It can take many shapes including &amp;ldquo;pump and dump&amp;quot; investment ploys where e-newsletters, emails and bulletin boards are used to entice investors. There are also pyramid schemes promising to turn small investments into big paydays provided you recruit fellow investors or&amp;nbsp;offers touting low-risk opportunities to invest in sophisticated-sounding products if you &amp;ldquo;act now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the sorts of red flags to be weary of, all investments carry risk and anything or anyone claiming otherwise should raise some concerns. In addition to&amp;nbsp;tools and advice&amp;nbsp;offered by your financial institution, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&amp;#39;s Investor Education Foundation has a series of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""http://www.finrafoundation.org/resources/tools/index.html"" target=""_blank""&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;sussing out seedy investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Talk to your financial institution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your wealth management team and financial institution is a key asset in navigating financial fraud. Thwarting financial losses as a result of fraud requires diligence, the sort of diligence that comes from knowing the scams and watching for red flags. But it&amp;#39;s also up to you to take the time to sit down with your financial advisor, and broader team, to review your accounts for suspicious activity, discuss potential investments and identify financial requests from outside sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no question cyberspace is fertile ground for digital deception. And con artists are only getting more sophisticated. Keeping pace means talking about it and raising awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scammers rely on shame, they rely on the embarrassment that can come from being duped and the best way to combat that is to talk about it with your financial team, with your family and with your community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what spurred the woman from Texas to come forward about her experience with &amp;ldquo;Charlie&amp;quot; and the online romance scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t want this to happen to anybody else. I not only invested money in this man but there is a big, huge piece of my heart that I invested in him,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s not just the finances, it&amp;#39;s the emotional part, too&amp;mdash;being embarrassed, being ashamed, being humiliated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Governments are shifting energy policies back in favor of fossil fuels in the short term, raising fears the energy transition may end up on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the new focus on energy security doesn&amp;rsquo;t irrevocably threaten the climate change mitigation agenda, in our view. Rather, the green energy transition, while slowing in the near term in some aspects, is very likely to accelerate in others, particularly in Europe. We explore the investment opportunities arising from the friction between security and climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Perilous dependency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;rsquo;s war on Ukraine has made energy security a pressing priority. It is not only the moral issue of replacing a rogue supplier that is using energy profits to finance an unprovoked war. Governments around the world also wish to shelter their citizens and economies from harmful spikes in global energy prices. The Russian invasion has exacerbated an existing uptrend in energy prices, with oil and gas prices leaping as much as 30 percent and 150 percent, respectively, before retreating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Exposure to Russian energy&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Europe is most exposed to Russian energy&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries are refocusing their energy policies, particularly&amp;mdash;but not exclusively&amp;mdash;those with a heavy reliance on Russian oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shortly after the invasion, the EU issued its new energy plan, REPowerEU, a roadmap to reduce Russian natural gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and to cut off Russian fuels completely by the end of the decade. Much of the implementation of this plan is left to the bloc&amp;rsquo;s member states. Most are looking for alternative suppliers of gas and to extend the life of coal-fired power plants to fill the gap in the short term. At the same time, the push for renewable energy is being jump-started.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The UK, having banned Russian energy imports entirely, issued its new British Energy Security Strategy in April. The plan focuses on more drilling for oil and gas in the short term, but it also calls for offshore wind and nuclear power to make up the shortfall over the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even countries that don&amp;rsquo;t rely much on Russian energy are reevaluating their energy strategies, looking for ways to boost energy output in an effort to alleviate elevated energy prices and to help countries scrambling to replace Russian energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The U.S. has reshaped climate and energy discussions since the Russian invasion due to crippling energy prices. Fossil fuels are no longer seen in as bad a light, and recognized as having an important role to play in mitigating the energy crisis. President Joe Biden, who recently signed a deal for the U.S. to supply Europe with liquefied natural gas (LNG) until at least 2030, has called for more fracking, and has gone as far as considering imposing fines on companies that do not use their federal leases to drill for oil. Still, no long-term changes to the U.S.&amp;rsquo;s energy policies have been announced, though key climate provisions within Biden&amp;rsquo;s Build Back Better legislation have stalled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unrelated to the invasion, the Canadian government issued a 271-page document at the end of March calling for a 42 percent reduction in the country&amp;rsquo;s oil and gas emissions from 2019 levels by the end of the decade as part of its 2030 emissions reduction goal. The document reiterates Canada&amp;rsquo;s commitments to climate change mitigation and the energy transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Going against the grain?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sense of urgency and in an effort to find a short-term fix, several strategies to increase energy supplies are being touted, including more drilling, diversifying LNG suppliers, and expanding the life of existing coal power plants. All would slow progress toward achieving net-zero emissions in the short term and seem like a step back in the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;More drilling&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization of the importance of energy security and the reaction to elevated energy prices have both led to calls to increase drilling in key oil-producing countries, such as the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, oil- and gas-rich Norway and the UK are also considering increasing domestic production. RBC Capital Markets sees potential for a significant jump in the UK&amp;rsquo;s North Sea activity in 2022, following a steady decline in capital expenditure since 2013. Many projects previously deemed uneconomical are becoming attractive in today&amp;rsquo;s elevated price environment. The emphasis is likely to be on gas developments given European gas prices are likely to stay firm over the coming years and Europe remains a significant importer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if the additional drilling comes at the expense of LNG imports, it could actually lower carbon emissions. In its recent report &amp;ldquo;The European Energy Trilemma&amp;rdquo; RBC Capital Markets calculated that LNG imports are at least three times more carbon-intensive than domestic gas production. Moreover, supporting domestic energy supplies is typically a cheaper alternative to imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, additional drilling does not necessarily mean unbridled drilling. The Canadian government&amp;rsquo;s recent approval of a $12 billion offshore oil project off the coast of Newfoundland sets out 137 legally binding conditions, including the requirement the project reaches net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada also released an energy plan in March 2022 that suggests rolling out a tax credit for carbon capture and storage, a process that can reduce 50 percent to 70 percent of carbon emissions from industrial processes. We would expect broad deployment of this tool to moderate carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are mitigating circumstances and additional drilling may not be as much a setback to climate goals as initially feared, the risk is that the world could remain locked into fuel dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Diversifying the LNG supplier base&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace Russian energy in the short term, many in Europe are focusing on diversifying natural gas supplies before the next winter. The second-round effect of this strategy may be to unintentionally increase carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the U.S. has upped its LNG shipments to the region and Canada has pledged to increase exports to Europe. Meanwhile, Germany has reached out to Qatar, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest exporter of natural gas with 15 percent of global exports, about obtaining more supply to meet its gas needs. Italy is also ramping up gas imports via its recently completed deal with Algeria, its second-largest supplier after Russia, for alternative supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether LNG is received from one supplier or another may not by itself increase carbon emissions. But the RBC Capital Markets report noted that a diversification of European LNG imports would likely mean that shipments are diverted away from Asian countries&amp;mdash;perhaps leaving them with little alternative than to burn more coal to meet their energy needs. Coal is a cheap but much more polluting alternative to natural gas, producing 50 percent more emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, merely tapping other sources of LNG supplies may have unwelcome knock-on effects for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Expanding the life of coal-fired plants&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of countries, including the UK and Germany, are considering expanding the life of coal-fired power plants previously designated for closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg estimates that burning additional coal instead of Russian gas would increase the EU&amp;rsquo;s carbon emissions by about eight percent. But it points out that as Europe isn&amp;rsquo;t planning to construct new coal power plants as part of its response to the crisis, any pollution created by new coal and oil imports could be offset by the scaling up of green energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Nuclear: The comeback kid?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortunes of nuclear power may be about to improve as some governments are attracted by its emissions-free attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 15 years to 2020, nuclear energy&amp;rsquo;s share of global electricity production fell from 17.5 percent to just over 10 percent. Nuclear accidents and leaks are one reason. Nuclear energy is not only slow to build and more expensive to produce but costs have also been going up, unlike most other energy sources. Then there is the thorny issue of how to dispose of nuclear waste. Finally, the materials used, from the steel that is manufactured to construct the power plant to uranium ore, aren&amp;rsquo;t renewable though nuclear energy itself is emissions-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the EU&amp;rsquo;s decision to label nuclear energy a &amp;ldquo;sustainable investment&amp;rdquo; earlier this year was controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite nuclear energy&amp;rsquo;s drawbacks, several governments and corporations are considering nuclear expansion. Recently, the UK, suffering from gas shortages and prone to a dearth of wind, announced it is looking at expanding the share of this energy source. France, which derives more than 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, more than any other country, announced the &amp;ldquo;renaissance&amp;rdquo; of the French nuclear industry, and plans to construct up to 14 new nuclear reactors by 2050. Both countries are also considering extending the life of existing nuclear plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation nuclear reactors known as small modular reactors may hold some promise as they are cheaper and quicker to build. Four Canadian provinces have announced plans for the new breed of small reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Poland, where 70 percent of electricity production burns coal, energy-intensive companies are spearheading the drive for greater use of nuclear energy. They are eager to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the &lt;a href=""https://read.rbcwm.com/31t7Z2d"" title=""Putting a price on carbon emissions""&gt;cost of which has increased relentlessly&lt;/a&gt; over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that energy security means a diversified portfolio of energy, nuclear does have a role to play in the energy transition, given that many renewable energy sources are intermittent. China is planning at least 150 new reactors in the next 15 years, or more than the world has built in the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Cost of electricity by source&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Electricity from renewables became cheaper as capacity increased; electricity from nuclear and coal did not&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Redoubling green energy efforts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond harnessing fossil fuel energy in the short term, and making difficult and at times controversial decisions to rethink their plans for nuclear energy, many governments are redoubling efforts toward energy efficiency at the same time. Developing a low-carbon economy could be a very effective energy security strategy. This is an opportunity in Europe, and it also may be so in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Ramping up wind and solar energy&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ember, an energy think tank, 50 countries around the world, including the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, and the UK, generate at least 10 percent of their energy needs from wind and solar. Denmark remains the leader, generating more than 50 percent of its energy from these sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewables&amp;rsquo; contribution is likely to grow further. RBC Capital Markets points out that the pace of renewable energy development in Europe has become increasingly important in recent months as the urgency for a shift from natural gas picks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the REPowerEU plan, investments to reduce emissions by 55 percent by 2030 relative to 1990 levels will be frontloaded, increasing the average deployment rate by 20 percent. Another 80 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity has also been targeted by 2030 to enable the production of more renewable hydrogen. Germany has brought forward its target of reaching 100 percent clean energy by 2035, or 15 years earlier than initially planned. Many countries lacking large deposits of fossil fuels will look to do the same as wind and solar are, after all, omnipresent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should help to ensure that the European Commission&amp;rsquo;s target of 40 percent renewable energy sources in the EU&amp;rsquo;s overall energy mix by 2030, twice the 2020 level, is reached earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, one of the main objectives of the new British Energy Security Strategy focuses on offshore wind. The government has increased its target for offshore wind generation to 50 GW by 2030, up from 40 GW, with a new target of 5 GW coming from floating turbines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing hurdles such as streamlining the lengthy and stringent planning permission requirements for renewable projects could arguably prove even more important than the increase in the rollout targets. The EU is set to publish a recommendation on fast-tracking the permitting of renewable energy projects in May. The UK government has likewise promised to implement reforms to cut approval times in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind and solar technologies are not magic wands, of course, as these will also need more infrastructure, including transmission lines, batteries, and charging stations for electric vehicles. Much of this will require mining projects in metals critical to building a green economy, such as aluminum, cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, silver, and zinc. Such mining will likely damage local environments and is often located in countries with high political risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Hydrogen revolution brought forward&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High gas prices are also changing the cost equation for hydrogen. Previously, &amp;ldquo;green hydrogen,&amp;rdquo; or hydrogen produced by electrolyser machines powered by solar and wind power, had long been considered too expensive to produce, costing up to four times as much as the cheaper, fossil fuel-derived &amp;ldquo;grey hydrogen.&amp;rdquo; It was thought that &amp;ldquo;blue hydrogen,&amp;rdquo; which uses carbon capture to remove the bulk of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted during production processes, would be the type of hydrogen most likely used in the short term to help achieve the green energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given the increase in the price of natural gas, the premium cost of green hydrogen has markedly declined. BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy, recently calculated that green hydrogen could be cost-effective today&amp;mdash;cost parity had previously not been expected until the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduced cost differential is happening at an opportune time. In late 2021, the EU launched a &amp;euro;2 billion partnership with industry to accelerate research and development in green hydrogen, which involved scaling up green hydrogen electrolysers from a megawatt to gigawatt scale to bring down the cost of the technology even further. The reduced price premium on green hydrogen makes the EU&amp;rsquo;s target for hydrogen to supply at least 10 percent of the bloc&amp;rsquo;s energy needs by 2050 appear more achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensing the opportunity, H2 Mobility Deutschland, a private German company, recently raised $120 million to more than triple the number of its hydrogen refueling stations by the end of the decade to 300. The aim is for these facilities to meet the demand for heavy-duty and long-haul transportation in Europe. The goal is to expand the hydrogen network along several popular transportation corridors and in cooperation with public authorities and fleet operators to ensure offtake for the stations, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the hydrogen industry, which until recently was struggling much like the wind farm industry had a decade ago before costs dropped and installations proliferated, is likely to enjoy stronger growth going forward, in our view, just as its wind energy predecessor did when the cost equation tilted in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Energy efficiency in focus&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With much effort being made toward increasing energy supply, the demand side should not be forgotten, and we expect energy efficiency will be increasingly in focus going forward. Measures such as switching to heat pumps and better-insulated houses also can reduce energy demand and hence the dependence on natural gas. While the British Energy Security Strategy disappointed many by omitting these measures, the recent budget announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak abolished the sales tax on energy efficiency measures such as home insulation and solar panels. Canada&amp;rsquo;s new energy roadmap includes an additional CA$500 million for the existing greener homes program, which helps cover the costs of similar energy-saving improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Portfolio implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imperatives of energy transition and energy security need not compete with each other. Developing a low-carbon economy could be a very effective energy security strategy. The current crisis may ultimately reveal itself as an opportunity, much like the energy crisis of the 1970s did, to foster energy innovation in a variety of areas including low-carbon technologies such as green hydrogen, nuclear, as well as carbon capture and storage, and the promising but still expensive direct air capture. On the demand side, much more can be done to reduce demand via energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the energy transition has become more complex and multifaceted, the energy security imperative has given it more impetus in certain areas. We continue to see many opportunities in the SusTech theme, particularly in &lt;a href=""https://read.rbcwm.com/3e8Q3hb"" title=""What will it take to transform to a clean energy world?""&gt;GreenTech&lt;/a&gt; as many of the drivers of energy security are critical to fighting climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Industries likely to benefit from energy security&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The pursuit of energy security could benefit a wide range of industries&lt;/h6&gt;
