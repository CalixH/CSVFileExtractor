&lt;h3&gt;Prepare for the Future With a College Savings Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=""/delegate/services/file/38692/content"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
College is an important part of your child&amp;rsquo;s future, but with education expenses continually on the rise, planning how to pay tuition can be daunting. In 2029&amp;mdash;when a current first grade student could be heading off to college&amp;mdash;the average cost of a four-year college education could be as much as $353,685 at an out-of-state public university or $453,681 at a private university.* That could mean a heavy burden for a young adult starting out in life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet today&amp;rsquo;s families often have competing financial priorities that can lead to difficult choices. For example, 49% of Americans place greater importance on saving for their children&amp;rsquo;s education than they do on saving for their own retirement, according to a 2016 survey commissioned by RBC Wealth Management. What can a concerned parent or grandparent do?
&lt;h3&gt;Consider the Benefits of a 529 Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
These state-sponsored investment programs are intended to help save for higher education. You can establish an account for anyone you want and the beneficiary can be of any age. Some key benefits of 529 plans include:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;you maintain control of the plan&amp;rsquo;s assets, and can even transfer the account to another beneficiary;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the funds are professionally managed;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;withdrawals for qualified educational expenses are federal income-tax free;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;some states offer tax advantages for local residents; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;plan assets are excluded from the contributor&amp;rsquo;s taxable estate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Grandparents can make it easier for their adult children to save for retirement by helping fund the grandchildren&amp;rsquo;s college expenses. Required minimum distributions from tax-deferred retirement accounts may be a source of funds. And up to five years&amp;rsquo; worth of the $14,000 annual gift tax exclusion (i.e. up to $70,000) per 529 plan beneficiary can be accelerated to fund the 529 without being subject to gift taxes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
College is an incredible time in your loved ones&amp;rsquo; lives when they&amp;rsquo;re learning who they are and how to be responsible adults. With smart planning now, we can help you avoid worrying about huge tuition bills or family debt. &lt;a href=""https://cms.broadridgeadvisor.com/Entity/3297/Site/6549/AssetContent/Edit/1053/301120/""&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; today to discuss whether a 529 plan is right for your family.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;* Based on the 2016-2017 average total costs of a four-year college education, including tuition, fees, room and board: $35,370 for public out-of-state, $45,370 for private (Trends in College Pricing &amp;copy; 2016 The College Board). Assumes 7% annual inflation adjustments (FinAid.org).&lt;br /&gt;

RBC Wealth Management is proud to support the Ronald McDonald House Charities &amp;ndash; Upper Midwest. Their mission is to provide a comfortable and caring home-away-from home that allows families to stay together and reduce stress during a child&amp;rsquo;s serious illness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the ways to help these families in their time in need is to provide a home-cooked meal. Cooks for Kids volunteers plan, prepare and serve buffet style meals every night as well as brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In July we had a group of volunteers from the Minnetonka office come together to provide dinner and their support for the families staying at the Ronald McDonald House on Oak Street. What we would consider to be a small gesture makes an enormous difference in the lives and families of children who are facing serious illnesses. Bringing smiles to their little faces and providing relief to their parents for even a short time makes what we do worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain the CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; certification, individuals must complete a comprehensive course of study at an approved college or university covering a multitude of financial planning topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Investments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Estate Planning&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon completion of the required coursework, individuals must pass a comprehensive, two-day, 10-hour examination that tests one&amp;rsquo;s ability to apply the knowledge they have obtained to real-life situations. This test is considered one of the most difficult in the industry, with only a 55-60%* pass rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ethics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond education, CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; professionals must adhere to a strict code of ethics, upholding principles of integrity, objectivity, competence, fairness, confidentiality, professionalism and diligence when providing service to others. These standards are monitored closely by the CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; Board and violation of these principles can result in the revocation of the designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why it should matter to you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of attributes that you can expect from an advisor with the CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; certification, including:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;being well-versed in developing integrated wealth management plans;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a robust theoretical and practical knowledge of investment products and services;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;an unwavering commitment to the highest ethics; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a steadfast commitment to putting your interests first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to experience the benefits of working with a CFP&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; professional for yourself. &lt;a href=""contact""&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; today to learn more or to schedule a complimentary consultation&lt;/p&gt;

Their mission is to provide a comfortable and caring home-away-from home that allows families to stay together and reduce stress during a child&amp;rsquo;s serious illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the ways to help these families in their time in need is to provide a home-cooked meal. Cooks for Kids volunteers plan, prepare and serve buffet style meals every night as well as brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In July we had a group of volunteers from the Minnetonka office come together to provide dinner and their support for the families staying at the Ronald McDonald House on Oak Street. What we would consider to be a small gesture makes an enormous difference in the lives and families of children who are facing serious illnesses. Bringing smiles to their little faces and providing relief to their parents for even a short time makes what we do worthwhile.

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Helping protect wildlife habitat in Montana&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clean water is essential for all aspects of our lives and the RBC Blue Water program focused on this idea for the past ten years with a $50 million commitment. In 2016, &lt;a href=""http://montanatu.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Montana Trout Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; received a community action grant from the RBC Blue Water Project to clean up and reconstruct a side channel on Rattlesnake Creek in Missoula, Montana. Our own financial advisor, Hal Tearse, supported the grant request and matched the grant nearly 2-1. During a recent trip to Missoula to inspect the completed project, Hal was pleased to find that the project was very successful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rattlesnake Creek flows for 26 miles, beginning in the Rattlesnake Wilderness north of Missoula, Montana. A dam, retrofitted with a fish ladder in 2004, bifurcates the Creek at mile 4.5. Although the first 21.5 miles of Rattlesnake Creek flow through either the Rattlesnake Wilderness or a recreation area within the Lolo National Forest, the final 4.5 miles flow through the City of Missoula and under two interstate highway overpasses, the Burlington Northern Railroad, and near several smaller local roads before entering the Clark Fork River. This final stretch receives pressure from agricultural demands as well as urban uses and environs. Within the final five miles, six irrigation ditches divert water from Rattlesnake Creek, buildings and development confine and channelize the creek and the urban landscape deposits trash, debris and toxins in the Creek and riparian habitat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Water rights in the western states are very contentious and often in conflict. In this case, water from Rattlesnake Creek is channeled to a variety of rights holders to irrigate land along the creek. But water wasn&amp;#39;t the only thing being diverted; young fish were also ending up in lawns and fields along this stretch of the river. The reconstruction project consisted of: repairing the stream banks; planting native species; cleaning the river bed from debris; and installing diversion gates with&amp;nbsp;screens that allow water for irrigation while preventing fish from being pulled into the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to Hal and the RBC Blue Water project, Montana Trout Unlimited was able to successfully reconstruct and protect the wildlife habitat along Rattlesnake Creek.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participating in our community by working with charitable organizations and collaborating with other businesses and economic development agencies is integral to our lives and approach to business. Please see the information below regarding some of the organizations we support and are involved with:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.constructinc.org""&gt;Construct Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provides comprehensive housing, support and educational services to anyone in the Southern Berkshire region who has lost his or her home or who lacks adequate financial resources to maintain safe, decent and affordable housing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terry serves as a member of the board of Construct and is on the finance committee. In addition to providing a $250 matching grant for employee donations to Construct, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;RBC Wealth Management Foundation has generously granted $5,000 in each of the last two years to fund essential programming provided by the organization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.gouldfarm.org""&gt;Gould Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the first residential therapeutic community in the nation dedicated to helping adults with mental illness move toward recovery, health and greater independence through community living, meaningful work and individual care.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terry and his wife Monica have actively supported Gould Farm for many years. Monica serves on the board and is a member of the executive committee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.wired-west.net""&gt;WiredWest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is a community-driven solution to our regional problem of inadequate broadband. They&amp;#39;re dedicated to building a community-owned, state of the art, fiber-optic network to serve the last mile in the Berkshires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to providing financial support to WiredWest, Terry&amp;rsquo;s wife Monica is chairperson of the organization and serves as spokesperson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.berkshire.coop/""&gt;The Berkshire Co-Op Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a cooperatively owned store, which offers healthy natural alternatives, and serves both members and the public. They sell abundant local organic produce and groceries in a farmer&amp;#39;s market atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.mahaiwe.org/""&gt;The Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has a mission to be the leading year-round presenter of performing arts, film, and educational programs for the Southern Berkshires and neighboring communities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through programs of the highest quality in dance, music, theatre and opera, they ensure a diversity of talent on the stage of their newly restored historic theater. The goal of the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center is to present available programs that appeal to all ages and interests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are an active sponsor and participant in events at the Mahaiwe. We also provide parking for school buses when they host events for local educational programs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.berkshiresouth.org/""&gt;Berkshire South Regional Community Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has a mission to build a sense of community and common purpose throughout the region, and to enhance the recreational, educational, cultural, health and social well-being of the residents of the Southern Berkshires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For many years we have provided sponsorship to Berkshire South and feel it plays a vital role in drawing our community together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Information Regarding Local Businesses and Projects of Interest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there continues to be considerable concern regarding the state of the local and national economy, there are many signs of sustainable recovery and dynamic growth potential in the Berkshires. We have highlighted some projects of interest below:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iredale Mineral Cosmetics &amp;ndash; Bryant School Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will reuse an historic local building to create class A office space enabling IMC to hire 50-60 new employees over the next several years. This will add to Great Barrington&amp;rsquo;s population and tax base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.townofgb.org/Pages/GBarringtonMA_Procurement/Main%20Street/Index""&gt;Great Barrington Downtown Reconstruction Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The $4.2 million Main Street Reconstruction Project is designed to repair and replace failing pavement, drainage and utilities due to aging infrastructure. It will also address issues related to traffic and pedestrian safety and result in general improvements to the downtown corridor. The funding for this project comes primarily from the Massachusetts department of transportation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Monument Mills Redevelopment&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Housatonic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Predominantly vacant and unused for the last 50 years, the possible redevelopment/reuse of the Monument Mills is an exciting economic development opportunity for the Berkshires.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When choosing a financial advisor to help you meet your wealth management goals, consider the benefits of working with someone that has a Certified Private Wealth Advisor&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; (CPWA&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;) designation. This well-regarded designation is awarded by the Investment Management Consultants Association&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; to professionals that have successfully completed the experience, education, examination, and ethics requirements of the certification program.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CPWA certification program is an advanced credential created specifically for wealth managers who work with high-net-worth clients, focusing on the life cycle of wealth: accumulation, preseveration and protection, and distribution. These professionals learn to identify and analyze challenges facing high-net-worth clients and understand&amp;nbsp;how to develop specific strategies to minimize taxes, monetize and protect assets, maximize growth, and transfer wealth.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Patricia Baum and Margaret Jackson are both Certified Private Wealth Advisors&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a CPWA&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt;, both Patti and Margie strictly adhere to principles as set below in the IMCA &lt;em&gt;Code of Professional Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Act in the best interest of the client.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disclose services to be offered and provided, related charges, and compensation. Disclose the existence of actual, potential, and/or perceived conflicts of interest and relevant financial relationships, direct and/or indirect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide clients information needed to make informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Respond to client inquiries and instructions appropriately, promptly, completely, and truthfully.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maintain confidentiality of client information, however acquired, consistent with legal and regulatory requirements and firm policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide competent service by truthful representation of competency, maintenance and/or development of professional capabilities, and, when appropriate, the recommendation of other professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to one&amp;#39;s practice of his or her profession.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maintain a high level of ethical conduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;My twin daughters, now&amp;nbsp;30 years old, were born premature at 28 weeks, weighing 2 lbs 2 ozs and 2 lbs 7 ozs. They spent the first three months of their lives at Texas Children&amp;#39;s Hospital&amp;nbsp;and my wife and I have been the hospital&amp;rsquo;s biggest fans ever since. In 2006 and 2007, I served as Chair of the organizing committee for the Bad Pants Open, a golf tournament benefiting the Newborn Center at Texas Children&amp;rsquo;s and remain an active member of the organizing committee for this event. This&amp;nbsp;year we raised $375,000 for the Newborn Center.&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=""http://letsmakeaplan.org/choose-a-cfp-professional/why-cfp-certification-matters""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Work With a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Certification Requirements&lt;/em&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     An individual that obtains their CFP® designation must meet rigorous education, testing, and ethical standards. These standards are held as some of the highest in the financial industry.
     &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;Education&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     There are almost 100 different financial planning topics that a financial advisor must study if they want to obtain their CFP® designation, including:
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;ul&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Investments &lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Income Tax Planning&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Retirement Planning&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Estate Planning&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Wealth Transfer Strategies&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Employee Benefits&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;Risk Management&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;br&gt; 
    &lt;/ul&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;In addition to learning how these different topics work and flow into each other to create a financial picture for an individual, they must continue their education, by going to numerous courses and seminars each year.
     &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;Examination&lt;/em&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;The CFP® exam is a comprehensive two-day, 10 hour examination that attests their ability to apply their learned topics to various wealth management issues and situations. This test is considered one of the most stressful and difficult examinations to pass.
     &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Through the Code of Ethics, financial advisors that have obtained their CFP® agree to act fairly and diligently when providing service to others. Failure to uphold the strict ethic code set forth can result in losing the designation.
     &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;What to Expect When Working With a CFP®&lt;/em&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;When working with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, you can expect to work with a financial advisor that is well versed in developing an integrated wealth management plan geared towards accomplishing your goals. You can also expect to receive the service of someone that will put their clients first.
    &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This year the tournament runs March 2nd&amp;nbsp;through April 6th, 2018. Brackets For Good is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that helps build awareness, raise funds, and expand marketing capabilities for local nonprofits through competitive, online fundraising tournaments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certification Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual that obtains their CFP&amp;reg; designation must meet rigorous education, testing, and ethical standards. These standards are held as some of the highest in the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;There are almost 100 different financial planning topics that a financial advisor must study if they want to obtain their CFP&amp;reg; designation, including:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Investments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Income Tax Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Retirement Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Estate Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wealth Transfer Strategies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Employee Benefits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Risk Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning how these different topics work and flow into each other to create a financial picture for an individual, they must continue their education, by going to numerous courses and seminars each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The CFP&amp;reg; exam is a comprehensive two-day, 10 hour examination that attests their ability to apply their learned topics to various wealth management issues and situations. This test is considered one of the most stressful and difficult examinations to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Through the Code of Ethics, financial advisors that have obtained their CFP&amp;reg; agree to act fairly and diligently when providing service to others. Failure to uphold the strict ethic code set forth can result in losing the designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to Expect When Working With a CFP&amp;reg;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When working with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&amp;trade;, you can expect to work with a financial advisor that is well versed in developing an integrated wealth management plan geared towards accomplishing your goals. You can also expect to receive the service of someone that will put their clients first.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src=""/delegate/services/file/67838/content""&gt;Prepare for the Future With a College Savings Plan&lt;/h3&gt; College is an important part of your child’s future, but with education expenses continually on the rise, planning how to pay tuition can be daunting. In 2029—when a current first grade student could be heading off to college—the average cost of a four-year college education could be as much as $353,685 at an out-of-state public university or $453,681 at a private university.* That could mean a heavy burden for a young adult starting out in life. 
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; Yet today’s families often have competing financial priorities that can lead to difficult choices. For example, 49% of Americans place greater importance on saving for their children’s education than they do on saving for their own retirement, according to a 2016 survey commissioned by RBC Wealth Management. What can a concerned parent or grandparent do? 
 &lt;h3&gt;Consider the Benefits of a 529 Plan&lt;/h3&gt; These state-sponsored investment programs are intended to help save for higher education. You can establish an account for anyone you want and the beneficiary can be of any age. Some key benefits of 529 plans include: 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;you maintain control of the plan’s assets, and can even transfer the account to another beneficiary;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;the funds are professionally managed;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;withdrawals for qualified educational expenses are federal income-tax free;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;some states offer tax advantages for local residents; and&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;plan assets are excluded from the contributor’s taxable estate.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; Grandparents can make it easier for their adult children to save for retirement by helping fund the grandchildren’s college expenses. Required minimum distributions from tax-deferred retirement accounts may be a source of funds. And up to five years’ worth of the $14,000 annual gift tax exclusion (i.e. up to $70,000) per 529 plan beneficiary can be accelerated to fund the 529 without being subject to gift taxes. 
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; College is an incredible time in your loved ones’ lives when they’re learning who they are and how to be responsible adults. With smart planning now, we can help you avoid worrying about huge tuition bills or family debt.

 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;* Based on the 2016-2017 average total costs of a four-year college education, including tuition, fees, room and board: $35,370 for public out-of-state, $45,370 for private (Trends in College Pricing © 2016 The College Board). Assumes 7% annual inflation adjustments (FinAid.org).&lt;br&gt; RBC Wealth Management is not a tax advisor. All decisions regarding tax implications of your investments should be made in consultation with your independent tax advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

Most recently, we were a key sponsor at the 11th annual Women&amp;rsquo;s Fund Lunch, raising funds to improve the lives of women and girls in Monterey County, specifically focusing on two grant priorities. The Girls&amp;rsquo; Health in Girls&amp;rsquo; Hands is a program that was created in 2009 as a girl-led action research project to identify health information, support and services needed by pre-teen and teen girls in Monterey County. The second grant is for the Advancing Women&amp;rsquo;s Economic Security program, which helps low-income women in Monterey County, especially those caring for children, gain access to the education, training, and support services they need to secure increased wages and jobs with advancement potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your dream of a lifetime: &lt;/strong&gt;What does retirement mean to you? Take a moment to picture how you&amp;rsquo;d like to fill your days. Your ability to live the lifestyle you envision will depend largely on your ability to achieve financial independence during your retirement years. Which is why you&amp;rsquo;ve worked so hard, saved and invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan to address retirement risks:&lt;/strong&gt; When your objective becomes a predictable retirement income, protecting assets on the downside becomes more important than out-performing on the up side. Therefore when you are investing during retirement you may be challenged by a set of risks you may not have experienced during the years when you were saving for your retirement. These risks are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Longevity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inflation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Market&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Health Care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are near retirement or have already retired, Holli Terry and Greg Hornok&amp;nbsp;can guide you through the retirement income planning process and help you put your plan into action &amp;ndash; to produce a reliable, steady stream of income during retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

       &lt;div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Texas Children's Hospital&lt;/h3&gt; My twin daughters, now&amp;nbsp;30 years old, were born premature at 28 weeks, weighing 2 lbs 2 ozs and 2 lbs 7 ozs. They spent the first three months of their lives at Texas Children's Hospital&amp;nbsp;and my wife and I have been the hospital’s biggest fans ever since. In 2006 and 2007, I served as Chair of the organizing committee for the Bad Pants Open, a golf tournament benefiting the Newborn Center at Texas Children’s and remain an active member of the organizing committee for this event. This&amp;nbsp;year we raised $375,000 for the Newborn Center.&lt;/div&gt;

     The formula Barron's uses to rank advisors is proprietary. It has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record.

It’s important to me that I help others not as fortunate in that regard.” -Maureen Kerrigan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Maureen, Courtney and Chris presented Star Kids with a $10,000 RBC Foundation Grant at the 2016 Annual Soiree, held at Salve Regina University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Star Kids is an organization that serves such a vulnerable part of our society – children in dysfunctional and/or disadvantaged homes. Star Kids recognizes the importance of a solid educational foundation for children to have the opportunity to break the cycles of substance abuse, crime, disease and poverty. The program focuses on structured, supervised academic mentoring and college preparatory activities. Students have a well proven track record of achievement in the classroom through a developed and supportive partnership between home, school and the community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maureen holds multiple roles as an active board member including executive, finance and strategic planning committees, as well as a long time sponsor and attendee of the Annual Soiree fundraiser. But most important and impactful to her is sponsoring a young boy. He is a second grader that she and her husband have provided educational financial support for since kindergarten and have committed to sponsoring for a minimum of four years. His family is one that has struggled with a parent who is either incarcerated, or drug/alcohol dependent. He and his sister were identified as meeting the “at risk” criteria of the program. This past year, Courtney has committed to sponsoring his sister when her sponsor could no longer fulfill their commitment.

We are helping them build a foundation for life by providing structure and support to their educational experience as they overcome challenges in their lives that many of us could only imagine.” – Maureen Kerrigan and Courtney Chellgren&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Below are details on community organizations we help support.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RBC Wealth Management Colorado Scholarship Fund&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RBC Wealth Management has a long-standing tradition of supporting the communities in which we do business. Locally, in 1999, we established the RBC Dain Rauscher Columbine High School Scholarship Fund after the tragedy that occurred there. After awarding 57 college scholarships to students at Columbine High School during the next four years, we expanded upon this educational philanthropy to start the RBC Wealth Management Colorado Scholarship Fund in 2003 which provides financial aid to deserving students throughout the entire state of Colorado.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fund has grown and developed into the RBC Wealth Management Colorado Scholarship Fund, providing financial aid to deserving students throughout the state. To date, the fund has awarded $338,672 in scholarships and grown the endowed portion of the fund to over $797,000 through&amp;nbsp;the generosity of RBC Wealth Management employees, clients and friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Typically, we have held a major annual fundraising event, which most recently has been a golf tournament and silent auction. For more information about making a contribution or participating in our&amp;nbsp;2021 fund raising event, please contact Bob Schneebeck, the founder and Chairman of the fund. You can also obtain additional information about the scholarship and how to apply by accessing the following link:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""http://www.denverfoundation.org/grants/page/colorado-high-school-students""&gt;http://www.denverfoundation.org/grants/page/colorado-high-school-students.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Range of Motion Project (ROMP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROMP&amp;rsquo;s mission is to provide high quality prosthetic care in underserved populations, which enhances mobility and unlocks human potential. We believe in equal access to prosthetic and orthotic services that facilitate independence through mobility. We recognize the dual hardships of living in poverty with a disability, and stand in solidarity with those who are made to suffer from an unequal distribution of care. We understand that disability is caused by broken devices and broken healthcare systems &amp;ndash; not broken bodies &amp;ndash; and we work to increase the mobility, visibility, and dignity of all those marginalized by lack of access to rehabilitative technology. Climbing for ROMP started in 2015 and continues to grow.&amp;nbsp;Cathy Anderson Hyams and Wendy Hulse&amp;nbsp;participated in a hike to raise money for the Range of Motion Project.

    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Harold began his business career in 1976 as an accountant/financial analyst, spending five years with one Fortune 500 industrial company. In 1981 he opted to pursue a more client-facing and relationship-driven career and, as he likes to say, “Talked his way into the financial advisory field…” at Advest, Inc. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Over the ensuing twenty-six years he held positions as stockbroker, account executive, branch manager and portfolio manager, all with Advest. He joined RBC Wealth Management as a Senior Vice-President, Financial Advisor in February 2006, where he continues to work directly with clients. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;He earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Pennsylvania State University as an accounting major, and did post-graduate work in Economics at the University of North Carolina. He has also completed many continuing education courses at The Advest Institute at Harvard University, and earned his Chartered Financial Analyst designation (CFA) from the Association for Investment Management &amp;amp; Research (now the CFA Institute). He is a member of 
     &lt;a href=""https://www.cfainstitute.org/pages/index.aspx""&gt;The CFA Institute&lt;/a&gt;, 
     &lt;a href=""http://www.bsas.org/""&gt;The Boston Security Analysts Society&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and is very involved within the New Hampshire community, serving on the investment committee at 
     &lt;a href=""https://www.crotchedmountain.org/""&gt;Crotched Mountain Foundation&lt;/a&gt;; as a board member of the Chichester Central School; and as an active supporter of the Chichester Youth Association. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Living in Chichester, NH with his wife and two daughters, Harold is an avid golfer and gardener, and enjoys all forms of an active, outdoor life.
    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With over 20 years of industry experience, Jennifer brings a wealth of knowledge and a high-level of responsiveness to her client relationships. Along with her strong New England ties, she graduated from Keene State College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. Interestingly, Jennifer first entered the industry as an intern during her senior year at college. While the position was not meant to lead to a full-time career, she stayed on when summer ended and, as she jokes, “Never had to complete another resume…” because the internship turned into a full-time position. She has been with the same team ever since, although it has grown and moved to RBC Wealth Management in 2006. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Today she holds the Series 3, 7 and 65 securities licenses, specializes in insurance and annuities products, and has earned the designation of Accredited Asset Management Specialist® through the 
     &lt;a href=""https://www.cffp.edu/""&gt;College for Financial Planning&lt;/a&gt;. She has also participated in numerous additional studies, including courses at the Advest Institute at Harvard University. 
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Community involvement is an important part of Jennifer’s personal and professional life as well. She is the past director and current committee member, as well as a regular financial supporter of the Webster Youth Soccer Program; and is a current board member and a 25-plus year volunteer and financial supporter of the 
     &lt;a href=""http://www.capitalregionfoodprogram.org/""&gt;Capital Region Food Program&lt;/a&gt;, a not-for-profit organization helping to reduce hunger in the Greater Concord Area. She also volunteers regularly for the Friends of 
     &lt;a href=""http://www.capitalregionfoodprogram.org/""&gt;Merrimack River Greenway Trail&lt;/a&gt;, is an active volunteer within the Merrimack Valley School District.
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;Currently residing in Webster, New Hampshire with her husband and son, Jennifer spends her free time camping in northern New England and the Canadian Maritimes, cooking and gardening with her family.
    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My Wealth Management approach integrates your objectives into a personalized plan that can be updated as life changes occur. I combine sophisticated investment planning tools with professional resources to help match your objectives with customized solutions. My process includes:&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;ul&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding Your Financial Objectives&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;- I begin by listening to understand you and your financial objectives. &lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gathering Your Current Financial Information&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Together, we gather specific information on your financial picture. &lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing Smart, Time-Tested Strategies&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Next, I analyze your financial and personal information to match your objectives with sound strategies. &lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementing Thoughtful and Creative Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;- I develop customized solutions tailored to your objectives, drawing from a wide selection of world-class products and services. &lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Providing Timely, Ongoing Service - &lt;/em&gt;I regularly review your situation to help ensure your financial objectives are being met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;/ul&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.letsmakeaplan.org/choose-a-cfp-professional/why-cfp-certification-matters""&gt;Why Choose a CFP®&amp;nbsp;Professional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.letsmakeaplan.org/choose-a-cfp-professional/why-cfp-certification-matters""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certification Requirements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;An individual that obtains their CFP® designation must meet rigorous education, testing, and ethical standards. These standards are held as some of the highest in the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;There are almost 100 different financial planning topics that a financial advisor must study if they want to obtain their CFP® designation, including:&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;ul&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Investments&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Income Tax Planning&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Retirement Planning&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Estate Planning&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Wealth Transfer Strategies&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Employee Benefits&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Risk Management&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;/ul&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to learning how these different topics work and flow into each other to create a financial picture for an individual, they must continue their education, by going to numerous courses and seminars each year.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CFP® exam is a comprehensive two-day, 10 hour examination that attests their ability to apply their learned topics to various wealth management issues and situations. This test is considered one of the most stressful and difficult examinations to pass.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the Code of Ethics, financial advisors that have obtained their CFP® agree to act fairly and diligently when providing service to others. Failure to uphold the strict ethic code set forth can result in losing the designation.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to Expect When Working With a CFP®&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;When working with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, you can expect to work with a financial advisor that is well versed in developing an integrated wealth management plan geared towards accomplishing your goals. You can also expect to receive the service of someone that will put their clients first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since joining RBC in 2006, financial advisor Dean Johnson has been organizing groups of employees each quarter to serve a meal with the University of Minnesota&amp;#39;s Ronald McDonald House Cooks for Kids program. Dean coordinates the food pick-up, delivery and preparation of evening meals and he and his team work together to serve the meal to the families staying at the house. The &lt;a href=""http://rmhtwincities.org/volunteer/CFK"" target=""_blank""&gt;Cooks for Kids program&lt;/a&gt; helps provide a home-away-from-home for families staying at the Ronald McDonald House (RMH) in Minneapolis while their child is in the hospital. After a long day at the hospital, a home-cooked meal can be a bright spot in a family&amp;rsquo;s day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Certification Requirements&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual that obtains their CFP&amp;reg; designation must meet rigorous education, testing, and ethical standards. These standards are held as some of the highest in the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are almost 100 different financial planning topics that a financial advisor must study if they want to obtain their CFP&amp;reg; designation, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Investments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Income Tax Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Retirement Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Estate Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wealth Transfer Strategies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Employee Benefits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Risk Management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to learning how these different topics work and flow into each other to create a financial picture for an individual, they must continue their education, by going to numerous courses and seminars each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Examination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The CFP&amp;reg; exam is a comprehensive two-day, 10 hour examination that attests their ability to apply their learned topics to various wealth management issues and situations. This test is considered one of the most stressful and difficult examinations to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Through the Code of Ethics, financial advisors that have obtained their CFP&amp;reg; agree to act fairly and diligently when providing service to others. Failure to uphold the strict ethic code set forth can result in losing the designation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What to Expect When Working With a CFP&amp;reg;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When working with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&amp;trade;, you can expect to work with a financial advisor that is well versed in developing an integrated wealth management plan geared towards accomplishing your goals. You can also expect to receive the service of someone that will put their clients first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay and his wife Julie Liberman believe it is their obligation to commit time to the organizations which help sustain communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Liberman currently serves as an officer at &lt;a href=""http://www.jfsdallas.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Jewish Family Service&lt;/a&gt; where she pioneered an annual community baby shower which has raised&amp;nbsp;hundreds of thousands&amp;nbsp;diapers for families in need. She is also a former board member of the North Texas chapter of the National Autism Association and the Autism Society of Collin County where she received the 2009 Angel Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay&amp;nbsp;chaired the Board of Directors of the &lt;a href=""http://www.jccdallas.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Jewish Community Center of Dallas&lt;/a&gt; from 2017-2019 where he received the Leader of the Year Award in 2013. Over a decade of service at the JCC, he has served as director, treasurer and Vice President. In 2018, Jay was invited to serve on the national board of JCC Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Jay and Julie co-chaired the Young Adult Event for the &lt;a href=""http://www.jewishdallas.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Jewish Federation of Greater Dallas&lt;/a&gt; and participated in their Leadership Development Group. Jay further co-chaired the Men&amp;rsquo;s Event for the JFGD in both 2013 and 2014 and served on the CEO search committee in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Jay and Julie together chaired the &lt;a href=""http://tjpnews.com/communing-with-nature/"" target=""_blank""&gt;J Naturescape&lt;/a&gt; project in an effort to reintroduce children to the world around them. Realizing that the youth of today spend the majority of their time indoors staring at televisions and computers, the Naturescape offers a safe, natural, outdoor environment to explore and enjoy. In 2015, Julie furthered this vision by chairing the Backyard project at Congregation Anshai Torah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2013 - 2015, Jay participated in the exclusive &lt;a href=""https://www.wexnerfoundation.org/about-us"" target=""_blank""&gt;Wexner Heritage Program&lt;/a&gt;. This intensive two-year study program, founded by Leslie H. Wexner in 1985, seeks to expand the leadership vision of its members, deepen their Jewish values, and bring a Jewish language of discourse to their policy and decision-making in the community. Jay currently serves as the Dallas representative on the program&amp;rsquo;s alumni network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2011, RBC awarded Jay the Community Spirit Award for his outstanding dedication and contributions to making a difference in his community through volunteerism. In 2014, Jay was further awarded the Dick McFarland Volunteer of the Year Award by RBC Wealth Management. This award is given to one individual within RBC Wealth Management each year that shows outstanding commitment to improving their community. In 2019, Jay and Julie were named among the &amp;quot;Real Mensches of DFW&amp;quot; by Levine Academy for their volunteer work and contributions to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we believe that the strength of the business is directly tied to the well-being of the communities where we do business, RBC Wealth Management has developed a series of programs to support community needs. In 2016, RBC Wealth Management contributed more than $4.4 million to charitable organizations through Foundation Grants, Employee Matching Gifts and Charitable Sponsorships.&lt;/p&gt;

The RBC Foundation has awarded the JCC grants from 2010 to 2018 to support a variety of programs consistent with its mission.&lt;/p&gt;

".org",".org","Tom Miller","Tommy Miller, CFA®, CRPC®","Drivers","us.rbcwealthmanagement.com/web/tommy.miller/building-your-portfolio-with-cost-transparency","<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?><root clientId=""A6229:contentForm:j_idt10:dynamicContent:j_id5"" xmlns=""http://www.veriday.com/xsd/content/content-base""><static-content clientId=""A6229:contentForm:j_idt10:dynamicContent:j_id6""><value>&lt;h3 class=""ckePara""&gt;Building your portfolio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=""ckePara""&gt;I believe there are two key components to building your portfolio. &amp;nbsp;Proper calibration of the asset allocation process and effective management of costs. &amp;nbsp;I apply&amp;nbsp;a rigorous process to evaluate decisions in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""ckePara""&gt;In 1952, through a paper published by the Journal of Finance,&amp;nbsp;Harry Markowitz&amp;nbsp;pioneered Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). &amp;nbsp;He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for the development of MPT. &amp;nbsp;Modern Portfolio Theory is a framework to construct a portfolio based on risk/reward characteristics of&amp;nbsp;the portfolio. &amp;nbsp;Individual&amp;nbsp;investment selection is evaluated by it&amp;#39;s contribution to the portfolio rather than it&amp;#39;s own risk/reward profile. &amp;nbsp;This allows an investor to maximize returns for a given level of risk. &amp;nbsp;This is important for your portfolio as it provides a foundation for&amp;nbsp;approaching&amp;nbsp;asset allocation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""ckePara""&gt;Asset allocation is the process of choosing asset classes for inclusion in the portfolio. &amp;nbsp;These include large, mid, and small cap stocks, international stocks, and various fixed income instruments. &amp;nbsp;Asset allocation decisions are critical for your portfolio as ninety percent of the variation in your&amp;nbsp;returns are determined by how you handle this process over the long term. &amp;nbsp;Please see below&amp;nbsp;resources to learn more about asset allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""ckePara""&gt;Understanding the costs associated with your portfolio is essential when analyzing portfolio performance. &amp;nbsp;Commission&amp;nbsp;based accounts handle costs on a per transaction basis. &amp;nbsp;Tracking costs in these accounts becomes challenging as not all transactions have the same cost. &amp;nbsp;For example, buying a single common stock is different than investing in mutual fund. &amp;nbsp;The stock purchase may have a cost to buy and sell it while mutual funds apply a &amp;quot;sales charge&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;load&amp;quot; upon purchase. &amp;nbsp;Fee based or managed accounts apply a fee to your account based on market value to cover all transaction costs. &amp;nbsp;Typically the fee is a percentage of the value. &amp;nbsp;For example, say your portfolio is valued at $100,000 and the fee is 1%. &amp;nbsp;Your cost is $1,000 for that year regardless of the number of transactions completed. &amp;nbsp;Each structure has pros and cons, and will impact your portfolio in different ways. &amp;nbsp;The CFA Institute published a fact sheet&amp;nbsp;on this topic, it provides useful information for investors: &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/factsheet/focus-on-fees-fact-sheet-aw-2017.ashx?la=en&amp;amp;hash=44B93CC76744492C20CAC20DECA712EC67298A6D""&gt;CFA fact sheet focus on fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;br&gt;The Cirque Investment Group’s Flowstone asset management&amp;nbsp;process aims to achieve long term investment results based on&amp;nbsp;risk adjusted parameters. Each asset management type has the&amp;nbsp;ability to invest in, stocks, bonds, preferred stocks, mutual funds,&amp;nbsp;ETFs and cash equivalent investments. Each model is rebalanced&amp;nbsp;quarterly.

     &lt;strong&gt;Flowstone conservative&amp;nbsp;investments&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt;
     The conservative income strategy&amp;nbsp;seeks income as a primary investment&amp;nbsp;objective, with growth as a secondary&amp;nbsp;goal. The model uses the following&amp;nbsp;investments:
     &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;br&gt;
     We would like to make you aware that the security you purchase may be considered to be a speculative and complex product that may not be suitable for a retail investor.&amp;nbsp; Risks associated with non-traditional Exchange Traded Products and non-traditional Mutual Funds (i.e. leveraged or inverse Exchange Traded Products or Mutual Funds) include, but are not limited to: a deviation from the performance of the underlying index due to a daily, monthly or other periodic reset feature and the use of a range of complex investment strategies including swaps, futures contracts and derivatives to achieve their stated objective.&amp;nbsp; This deviation is magnified by the volatility in the underlying index and will cause returns that vary from the returns of the underlying index.&amp;nbsp;

      &lt;strong&gt;Flowstone balanced investments&lt;/strong&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div&gt;
      The balanced strategy is designed to&amp;nbsp;have a balanced allocation between&amp;nbsp;bonds and equities. The balanced model&amp;nbsp;can use the following investments:
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h3&gt;Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) &amp;mdash;&lt;/h3&gt;
The&amp;nbsp;ETF&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to mirror the macro&amp;nbsp;economy as seen by the strategy&amp;nbsp;manager. There are no restrictions on&amp;nbsp;what type of ETFs can be used as long&amp;nbsp;as they are approved by RBC Portfolio&amp;nbsp;Focus guidelines. Additionally, ETFs can&amp;nbsp;be used to gain exposure to the fixed income markets as deemed necessary&amp;nbsp;due to market conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Individual stocks &amp;mdash;&lt;/h3&gt;
The individual&amp;nbsp;stocks are intended to generate Alpha &lt;sup&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;within the Teton Equity Model. There&amp;nbsp;are no restrictions as to sector, market&amp;nbsp;capitalization, sector or region as&amp;nbsp;long as they are approved by the RBC&amp;nbsp;Portfolio Focus guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cash &amp;mdash;&lt;/h3&gt;
U.S. dollars, short term&amp;nbsp;treasuries, bonds, bond funds and CD&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;can be used without restraint&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The investment parameters are&amp;nbsp;as follows:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maximum initial exposure to&amp;nbsp;one ETF or individual stock is&amp;nbsp;8% weighting of the strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Minimum initial exposure to&amp;nbsp;one ETF or individual stock&amp;nbsp;is 1%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Weighting will be adjusted&amp;nbsp;after initial purpose on a&amp;nbsp;weekly basis as determined&amp;nbsp;by the strategy manager&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mandatory sale of any ETF&amp;nbsp;or individual stock if that&amp;nbsp;holding falls below 12% of&amp;nbsp;the initial purchase price&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dividends to be paid in cash,&amp;nbsp;unless determined by the&amp;nbsp;strategy manager&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;My Investment Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;I recommend a strategic buy-and-hold asset allocation strategy that is a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, cash and alternative investments. In addition, I will closely monitor market and economic events to identify short-term investment opportunities. I will add tactical managers or funds as appropriate to help take advantage of the upside, yet still help provide some protection on the downside.
 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;I have been working in the Financial Services industry since 1996. I graduated from Augsburg College in Minneapolis MN. Recently, I earned the firm’s internal, professional designation of Accredited Wealth Manager (AWM) through an education program sponsored by RBC Wealth Management and Michigan State University. By attaining the AWM designation, I have demonstrated advanced knowledge of the firm’s wealth management process, concentrating in the areas of business and retirement planning, insurance solutions, charitable giving, advanced investment strategies, and estate and trust planning strategies.
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Personal&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;I live with my two children, Jon and Emily, and our black golden doodle Buddy&amp;nbsp;in Lake Elmo, in the heart of the St. Croix Valley. We enjoy the outdoors together, swimming, biking, and fishing. &amp;nbsp;For the last&amp;nbsp;Five years I have been an active member and supporter of 
 &lt;a href=""http://www.ducks.org/Minnesota""&gt;Ducks Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, Stillwater Chapter. &amp;nbsp;I also spend time volunteering for 
 &lt;a href=""http://www.couragecenter.org""&gt;Courage Center&lt;/a&gt; St. Croix and Camp Courage in Maple Lake, MN.

   &lt;div&gt;
    After graduating from 
    &lt;a href=""http://www.asu.edu/""&gt;Arizona State University’s&lt;/a&gt; College of Liberal Arts &amp;amp; Sciences in 1994, I started in the securities industry and worked my way up to becoming a Wealth Manager. Currently, I hold the Series 7, 63, and 65 securities licenses. Additionally, I have an agent license for life and health insurance in various states.
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    I&amp;nbsp;completed&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;a href=""http://www.bryant.edu/""&gt;Bryant University’s&lt;/a&gt; Certificate Program in Financial Planning, and in 2012, after&amp;nbsp;fullfilling the required coursework at the College of Financial Planning, I received my 
    &lt;a href=""http://www.cfp.net/""&gt;CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™&lt;/a&gt; certificate. The multi-year CFP
    ® program entails in-depth courses, training and compreshensive examinations in all areas of financial planning including investments, taxes, insurance, estate, and retirement planning. Additionally, I am a member of the &lt;a href=""http://www.plannersearch.org/why-cfp/Pages/Why-Hire-a-Certified-Financial-Planner.aspx""&gt;Financial Planning Association&lt;/a&gt;.
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    As a Chartered Retirement Plans Specialist (CRPS®), I assist businesses, large and small, in the construction, implementation and management of their company retirement plans.&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;My previous firm experience includes three years at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown as an associate and six years as a financial advisor at UBS Financial Services Inc., before joining RBC Wealth Management in 2009.
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;I regularly host continuing education classes for Certified Public Accountants, and wrote a monthly financial column, titled ""Sound Advice,"" in 
    &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.capitalgazette.com/""&gt;The Capital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. 
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;My recent honors include being selected as a Finalist for 
    &lt;em&gt;The Capital &lt;/em&gt;newspaper's 2011 Readers Choice Awards, People To Watch 2012 in 
    &lt;em&gt;What's Up Magazine.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personal&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;div&gt;
  Currently, I live in Annapolis, Maryland, with my wife and two children, where I enjoy being active in my community and serving on the board of directors for the 
  &lt;a href=""http://www.am-fm.org""&gt;Annapolis Musicians Fund for Musicians&lt;/a&gt; (AMFM) as vice-president. My prior leadership roles have contributed to the success of the Annapolis Business Association, Downtown Annapolis Partnership, Maryland Seafood Festival, Eastport-A-Rockin’ Street Festival, the Entrepreneurs’ Exchange organization, the Admiral Heights Improvement Association board of directors, Chairman of the 2014 City of Annapolis Economic Development Transition Team, the City of Annapolis Alcohol Beverage Control Board, and the Annapolis &amp;amp; Anne Arundel County Chamber of Commerce.
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;In my free time, I like to&amp;nbsp;snow ski, sail and cheer on the Arizona State University Sun Devils.

 &lt;strong&gt;Wealth Management Approach&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;Together with the team of professionals at RBC Wealth Management,&amp;nbsp;I serve both business and personal clients.&amp;nbsp;I develop strategies and recommend customized solutions designed to meet various current and future financial goals for individuals such as: retiring with dignity regardless of market conditions, funding college expenses, and leaving financial legacies. For business clients,&amp;nbsp;I can&amp;nbsp;provide consulting services for retirement plans. For non-profit clients,&amp;nbsp;I consult on the development and financial management of endowments.&amp;nbsp;My wealth management focus is client-centered, dynamic, and proactive. Clients know they can depend on&amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp;to be accessible, accountable, and responsive to the many changes they will face throughout their lives.

 &lt;strong&gt;Teresa's Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;My career in the financial services industry began in 1980 within the credit union industry and transitioned into the investment consulting business in 1986. For the first 11 years, I worked at a major regional firm; over the next five years, I further refined my wealth management experience by assisting clients in wealth preservation, accumulation, and transfer at a major national firm. In 2003, I joined RBC Wealth Management to enhance my ability to deliver real solutions for clients. I hold the Series 7 and 65 licenses and am licensed in life, disability, and long-term care insurance.
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; In my ongoing quest to become more knowledgeable, I pursued professional development opportunities not required by the firm. In 2005, I earned the earned the Certified Financial Planner, CFP
 &lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; certification followed in 2008 by the Accredited Investment Fiduciary
 &lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; professional designation. The latter is awarded by the Center for Fiduciary Studies, associated with the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Executive Education consisting of formal training in investment fiduciary responsibility.
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Personal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I am a native Montanan and the eldest daughter of small business owners. The family business, Darnielle Insurance, continues to operate in Billings. My husband, Mark, and I enjoy our home in the country and take advantage of plentiful opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors. My biggest passion, outside of work, remains playing the piano. I started with my mother's encouragement as a child, studied music in college, and continue to practice, study and perform as often as I can. 
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;For many years, I have enjoyed being involved in projects that benefit my community. I am one of the founding board members and currently serve as 2016 Board President and Assistant Vice President of Planned Giving for the 
 &lt;a href=""http://bcfpages.homestead.com/index.html""&gt;Billings Community Foundation &lt;/a&gt;(BCF). Besides volunteering to help with advocacy and planned giving for the BCF, I have served on a variety of nonprofit operating and endowment boards over the years. In addition, I served on the statewide Montana Advisory Council for Community Foundations of Montana. I remain a longstanding member and former president of 
 &lt;a href=""http://www.montanamafe.org/""&gt;MAFE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Montana Association for Female Executives) as well as a current board member of RBC's Women's Association of Financial Advisors (WAFA). In 2016, I was awarded an honorable mention for philanthropic excellence in the 10th annual Invest in Others Community Leadership Awards sponsored by the Invest in Others Chaqritable Foundation which recognizes the charitable work of financial advisors across the country and around the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Cirque Investment Group&amp;rsquo;s Flowstone asset management&amp;nbsp;process aims to achieve long term investment results based on&amp;nbsp;risk adjusted parameters. Each asset management type has the&amp;nbsp;ability to invest in, stocks, bonds, preferred stocks, mutual funds,&amp;nbsp;ETFs and cash equivalent investments. Each model is rebalanced&amp;nbsp;quarterly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flowstone conservative&amp;nbsp;investments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conservative income strategy&amp;nbsp;seeks income as a primary investment&amp;nbsp;objective, with growth as a secondary&amp;nbsp;goal. The model uses the following&amp;nbsp;investments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to make you aware that the security you purchase may be considered to be a speculative and complex product that may not be suitable for a retail investor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Risks associated with non-traditional Exchange Traded Products and non-traditional Mutual Funds (i.e. leveraged or inverse Exchange Traded Products or Mutual Funds) include, but are not limited to: a deviation from the performance of the underlying index due to a daily, monthly or other periodic reset feature and the use of a range of complex investment strategies including swaps, futures contracts and derivatives to achieve their stated objective.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This deviation is magnified by the volatility in the underlying index and will cause returns that vary from the returns of the underlying index.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For more information regarding non-traditional Exchange Traded Products and non-traditional Mutual Funds, please consult the FINRA website at &lt;a href=""http://www.finra.org/""&gt;www.finra.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.finra.org/"" target=""_blank""&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Available resources include an investor alert, FAQ, podcast, Fund Analyzer and regulatory notices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bond, equity and hybrid mutual&amp;nbsp;funds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;United States Treasury Bonds, Bills&amp;nbsp;and Notes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guggenheim BulletShare ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Preferred stocks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Money markets and money market&amp;nbsp;alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flowstone balanced investments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balanced strategy is designed to&amp;nbsp;have a balanced allocation between&amp;nbsp;bonds and equities. The balanced model&amp;nbsp;can use the following investments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Traditional bonds and other fixed&amp;nbsp;income investments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Guggenheim BulletShare ETF&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Preferred stocks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alternative investments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Money markets and money market&amp;nbsp;alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flowstone balanced growth and&amp;nbsp;income investments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The balanced strategy&amp;rsquo;s primary&amp;nbsp;investment objective is growth and&amp;nbsp;income. The model uses the following&amp;nbsp;investments:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Equity, bond and hybrid mutual&amp;nbsp;funds1&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Common stocks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Preferred stocks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Equity ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bond ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;REITs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alternative investments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Money market funds and money&amp;nbsp;market alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flowstone growth investments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The growth strategy&amp;rsquo;s primary objective&amp;nbsp;is long-term growth. The model uses the&amp;nbsp;following investments:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Equity and hybrid mutual funds1&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Common stocks&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am very passionate about this group &amp;ndash; I know that I am who I am today because of the opportunities I had growing up in a great family and having a good education. It&amp;rsquo;s important to me that I help others not as fortunate in that regard.&amp;rdquo; -Maureen Kerrigan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maureen, Courtney and Chris presented Star Kids with a $10,000 RBC Foundation Grant at the 2016 Annual Soiree, held at Salve Regina University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star Kids is an organization that serves such a vulnerable part of our society &amp;ndash; children in dysfunctional and/or disadvantaged homes. Star Kids recognizes the importance of a solid educational foundation for children to have the opportunity to break the cycles of substance abuse, crime, disease and poverty. The program focuses on structured, supervised academic mentoring and college preparatory activities. Students have a well proven track record of achievement in the classroom through a developed and supportive partnership between home, school and the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maureen holds multiple roles as an active board member including executive, finance and strategic planning committees, as well as a long time sponsor and attendee of the Annual Soiree fundraiser. But most important and impactful to her is sponsoring a young boy. He is a second grader that she and her husband have provided educational financial support for since kindergarten and have committed to sponsoring for a minimum of four years. His family is one that has struggled with a parent who is either incarcerated, or drug/alcohol dependent. He and his sister were identified as meeting the &amp;ldquo;at risk&amp;rdquo; criteria of the program. This past year, Courtney has committed to sponsoring his sister when her sponsor could no longer fulfill their commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;rdquo;We are honored knowing that RBC in its support of Star Kids is making a measurable impact in the lives of over 100 students and their families each year. We are helping them build a foundation for life by providing structure and support to their educational experience as they overcome challenges in their lives that many of us could only imagine.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Maureen Kerrigan and Courtney Chellgren&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing&amp;mdash;an approach to wealth management that integrates your core values and your financial goals, helping ensure that the investments you&amp;rsquo;re choosing align with your value system and that your funds are being used to impact society for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruelty-Free Investing (also sometimes called Vegan Investing or Animal Welfare Investing) is a subcategory within ESG that allows you to further customize your investments to specifically protect or benefit animals&amp;mdash;by ensuring that plant-based eating preferences, aversion to factory farming and vivisection, and the humane treatment for all living beings is reflected in your investment choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cruelty-Free Investing catalysts*&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Animal factory farming is exposed to at least 28 environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that could significantly damage financial value over the short or long-term. Many of these risks are currently hidden from investors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All 28 issues can potentially affect the financial performance of companies across the food value chain, including large agri-business, food retailers and restaurants. For additional information, please refer to the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) Report &lt;a href=""http://www.fairr.org/resource/plant-based-profits-investment-risks-opportunities-sustainable-food-systems/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Plant-Based Profits: Investment Risks and Opportunities in Sustainable Food Systems&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A knowledge gap exists within the investment community about managing these risks and opportunities. Even among those investors who are integrating ESG issues into their investment decision-making processes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The window of opportunity for investors to act is finite and shrinking. The magnitude of risks generated by animal factory farming is set to increase through rising capital costs, the shifting gravity of production to developing countries with less robust regulation, the impacts of climate change and increasing social concerns over animal welfare and sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional information, please refer to the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) report: &lt;a href=""http://www.fairr.org/resource/factory-farming-assessing_investment_risks/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Factory Farming: Assessing Investment Risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A personalized approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in Cruelty-Free Investing is to work together to draft an investment policy statement that defines your desired animal welfare impact and financial goals. I then use the policy to select investment strategies and securities that are appropriate for your specific needs. All areas of cruelty-free are considered to help ensure prudent customization within the security selection process. Once we have selected the right mix of investments, I monitor your RBC portfolio on an ongoing basis to make sure&amp;nbsp;it stays aligned with your values and wealth management objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether your goals is maintain a conservative or an aggressive risk profile, it is possible to construct a well-diversified portfolio while adhering to the beliefs you hold most dear. I invite you to &lt;a href=""./contact""&gt;contact me today&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Cruelty-Free&amp;nbsp;Investing and how I can help you reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

MS is different for everyone, and that makes it all the more challenging to solve. The first Walk MS event was in 1988, and since then more than $970 million has been raised for research and programs to improve the lives of people living with MS. Today, there are treatments where there weren&amp;#39;t any before, and the dream of ending MS is becoming a reality. But there is still so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon completion of the required coursework, individuals must pass a comprehensive, two-day, 10-hour examination that tests one&amp;rsquo;s ability to apply the knowledge they have obtained to real-life situations. This test is considered one of the most difficult in the industry, with only a 55-60%* pass rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ethics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond education, CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; professionals must adhere to a strict code of ethics, upholding principles of integrity, objectivity, competence, fairness, confidentiality, professionalism and diligence when providing service to others. These standards are monitored closely by the CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; Board and violation of these principles can result in the revocation of the designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why it should matter to you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of attributes that you can expect from an advisor with the CFP &lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; certification, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;being well-versed in developing integrated wealth management plans;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a robust theoretical and practical knowledge of investment products and services;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;an unwavering commitment to the highest ethics; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a steadfast commitment to putting your interests first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to experience the benefits of working with a CFP&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; professional for yourself. &lt;a href=""contact""&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; today to learn more or to schedule a complimentary consultation&lt;/p&gt;

After completing the extensive curriculum required, Brian earned the certification of CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP®). He is licensed by the Maryland Insurance Administration and his industry licenses include the Series 7, 31, 63 and 65. Brian is also an Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF®), which represents his advanced training and competency in the subject of fiduciary responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from his notable standing within RBC Wealth Management, Brian has earned accolades and respect within the financial industry.

Brian has also been cited as an Influential Marylander by The Daily Record. From the time RBC Wealth Management acquired Ferris Baker Watts, Brian has been a member of the firm's Chairman's Council, an honor bestowed on the top 150 Financial Advisors of RBC Wealth Management Financial Advisors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian is a financial commentator on Baltimore’s WBAL news radio and television network. You can listen to him every Saturday morning at 10:00 AM on WBAL Radio hosting the ""Brian Kroneberger Financial Hour.""

      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     The formula Barron's uses to rank advisors is proprietary. It has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record.

     &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Brian began his career as a financial advisor with Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. in 1991. During his tenure at Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc., Brian had the pleasure of working directly with Julius Westheimer, who was widely recognized as a renowned financial advisor in the Baltimore metropolitan area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With over twenty four years of investment experience, Brian has attained the Accredited Wealth Manager designation through the Estate and Wealth Strategies Institute of Michigan State University. After completing the extensive curriculum required, Brian earned the certification of CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP®). He is licensed by the Maryland Insurance Administration and his industry licenses include the Series 7, 31, 63 and 65. Brian is also an Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF®), which represents his advanced training and competency in the subject of fiduciary responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from his notable standing within RBC Wealth Management, Brian has earned accolades and respect within the financial industry. He has been recognized by Barron's as one of the Top 1,200 Financial Advisors in the country in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and by Barron's as one of the Top 1,000 Financial Advisors since 2010. Brian has also been cited as an Influential Marylander by The Daily Record. From the time RBC Wealth Management acquired Ferris Baker Watts, Brian has been a member of the firm's Chairman's Council, an honor bestowed on the top 150 Financial Advisors of RBC Wealth Management Financial Advisors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian is a financial commentator on Baltimore’s WBAL news radio and television network. You can listen to him every Saturday morning at 10:00 AM on WBAL Radio hosting the ""Brian Kroneberger Financial Hour."" If you miss him on Saturday you can catch him weekdays at 7:50 AM on WBAL radio providing timely market insight during his ""Money Report."" In addition to Brian’s daily presence on WBAL radio, he makes frequent appearances on WBAL Television.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian currently serves as the Chair on the Investment Committee for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""http://www.ccfmd.org/boardoftrustees.php""&gt;Catholic Community Foundation of the Archdiocese of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he is a Board of Trustee for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""http://www.calverthall.com/page""&gt;Calvert Hall College High School.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Brian attended Calvert Hall College High School and graduated from Loyola University with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance. Brian was a Three Time All-American lacrosse player at Loyola University and played eight years professionally with the Baltimore Thunder of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League. He is a member of both The Greater Baltimore Lacrosse Chapter and the Loyola University Hall of Fame. Brian is married with three children.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;div&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     The formula Barron's uses to rank advisors is proprietary. It has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record.

&lt;p&gt;For many investors, financial considerations are the top priority when making decisions about asset allocation or individual securities. But there is increasing demand for responsible investing strategies that allow you to go beyond these financial factors to make investments that support your deeply held personal beliefs in addition to helping you build and preserve your wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A growing trend&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible investing encompasses a number of investing approaches you may have heard of, including Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), Environmental, Social, and Governance Investing (ESG), and Impact Investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible investing assets have more than doubled in the last five years, according to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.ussif.org/files/SIF_Trends_16_Executive_Summary(1).pdf""&gt;Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;growing from $3.7 trillion in 2010 to $8.1 trillion in 2016. That means that one out of every five dollars under professional management in the United States is involved in a responsible investing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A sensible investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond supporting the causes or beliefs you hold dear, responsible investing can have a positive impact on performance. A 2012 meta-analysis by DB Climate Change Advisors of more than 100 academic studies found that incorporating ESG data in investment analysis is &amp;ldquo;correlated with superior risk-adjusted returns at a securities level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A matter of choice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible investing offers a high degree of flexibility. First, determine what is important to you. Then identify how you want to act on your beliefs by using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;SRI best practices to withdraw support from securities issuers you don&amp;rsquo;t want to put your financial support behind;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ESG best practices to proactively support securities issuers who are &amp;ldquo;best actors&amp;rdquo; in terms of the priorities you wish to promote; or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Impact investing best practices to put your capital to work finding solutions for causes that are meaningful to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Simple changes; big impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple changes to how you invest may help make a dramatic impact on both your financial life and the change you want to see in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://us.rbcwealthmanagement.com/danny.mcnulty/contact""&gt;Contact me&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;today to learn more or set up a free consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

They spent the first three months of their lives at Texas Children's Hospital&amp;nbsp;and my wife and I have been the hospital’s biggest fans ever since. In 2006 and 2007, I served as Chair of the organizing committee for the Bad Pants Open, a golf tournament benefiting the Newborn Center at Texas Children’s and remain an active member of the organizing committee for this event.

&lt;div&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m not a native Houstonian, I have lived most of my adult life here and consider it to be my home.

&lt;h3&gt;Proud to Be Named Volunteer of the Year&lt;/h3&gt;
I am honored to have been named RBC Wealth Management&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Volunteer of the Year for my work helping children and people of need in the Houston area. I am incredibly passionate about community involvement, and I am very proud to be recognized for those efforts and to have made an impact in our community.

They spent the first three months of their lives at Texas Children&amp;#39;s Hospital&amp;nbsp;and my wife and I have been the hospital&amp;rsquo;s biggest fans ever since. In 2006 and 2007, I served as Chair of the organizing committee for the Bad Pants Open, a golf tournament benefiting the Newborn Center at Texas Children&amp;rsquo;s and remain an active member of the organizing committee for this event. This&amp;nbsp;year we raised $375,000 for the Newborn Center.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing&amp;mdash;an approach to wealth management that integrates your core values and your financial goals, helping ensure that the investments you&amp;rsquo;re choosing align with your value system and that your funds are being used to impact society for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cruelty-free investing (also sometimes called vegan investing or animal welfare investing) is a subcategory within ESG that allows you to further customize your investments to specifically protect or benefit animals&amp;mdash;by seeing that plant-based eating preferences, aversion to factory farming and vivisection, and the humane treatment for all living beings is reflected in your investment choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cruelty-free investing catalysts*&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal factory farming is exposed to at least 28 environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that could significantly damage financial value over the short or long-term. Many of these risks are currently hidden from investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 28 issues can potentially affect the financial performance of companies across the food value chain, including large agri-business, food retailers and restaurants. For additional information, please refer to the &lt;a href=""https://www.fairr.org/article/plant-based-profits-investment-risks-opportunities-sustainable-food-systems/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) Report Plant-Based Profits: Investment Risks and Opportunities in Sustainable Food Systems.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A knowledge gap exists within the investment community about managing these risks and opportunities. Even among those investors who are integrating ESG issues into their investment decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The window of opportunity for investors to act is finite and shrinking. The magnitude of risks generated by animal factory farming is set to increase through rising capital costs, the shifting gravity of production to developing countries with less robust regulation, the impacts of climate change and increasing social concerns over animal welfare and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional information, please refer to the &lt;a href=""https://www.fairr.org/article/factory-farming-assessing-investment-risks/"" target=""_blank""&gt;Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) report: Factory Farming: Assessing Investment Risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A personalized approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in cruelty-free investing is to work together to draft an investment policy statement that defines your desired animal welfare impact and financial goals. We&amp;nbsp;then use the policy to select investment strategies and securities that are appropriate for your specific needs. All areas of cruelty-free are considered to help ensure prudent customization within the security selection process. Once we have selected the right mix of investments, our team monitors your RBC portfolio on an on-going basis to make sure it stays aligned with your values and wealth management objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting started&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether your goals is maintain a conservative or an aggressive risk profile, it is possible to construct a well-diversified portfolio while adhering to the beliefs you hold most dear. We invite you to &lt;a href=""https://us.rbcwm.com/thecomprehensiveimpactinvestmentgroup/contact"" target=""_blank""&gt;contact us today&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about cruelty-free investing and how we&amp;nbsp;can help you reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
