This award does not evaluate the quality of services provided to clients and is not indicative of this advisor&rsquo;s future performance. The financial advisor does not pay a fee to be considered for or to receive this award.</p>

<p>Source:&nbsp;Forbes.com&nbsp;(February, 2017). &nbsp;America&rsquo;s Top Women Wealth Advisors ranking was developed by SHOOK Research and is based on in-person and telephone due&nbsp;diligence meetings and a ranking algorithm that includes: client retention, industry experience, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and quantitative criteria,&nbsp;including: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms. Investment performance is not a criterion because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and&nbsp;advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Rankings are based on the opinions of SHOOK Research, LLC and not indicative of future performance or representative of&nbsp;any one client&rsquo;s experience. &nbsp;Neither Forbes nor SHOOK Research receives compensation in exchange for placement on the ranking. Approximately 7% of the nominees received this award. For more information:&nbsp;www.SHOOKresearch.com.&nbsp;</p>

".com",".com","2020 Forbes Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisor","<p>Source: Forbes.com (July, 2020). SHOOK considered advisors born in 1981 or later with a minimum 4 years as an advisor. Advisors have: built their own&nbsp;practices and lead their teams; joined teams and are viewed as future leadership; or a combination of both. Ranking algorithm is based on qualitative&nbsp;measures: telephone and in-person interviews, client retention, industry experience, credentials, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and&nbsp;quantitative criteria, such as: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms. Investment performance is not a criterion because client&nbsp;objectives and risk tolerances vary, and advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Rankings are based on the opinions of SHOOK Research, LLC,&nbsp;which does not receive compensation from the advisors or their firms in exchange for placement on a ranking, and are not indicative of future performance&nbsp;or representative of any one client&rsquo;s experience. The financial advisor does not pay a fee to be considered for or to receive this award. This award does&nbsp;not evaluate the quality of services provided to clients. This is not indicative of this financial advisor&rsquo;s future performance. For more information see&nbsp;www.SHOOKresearch.com.</p>","PRE_APPROVED"

Advisors were rated based on a proprietary algorithm of qualitative and quantitative criteria: assets under management, revenues generated for their firms, client retention, industry experience, credentials, and compliance records. SHOOK Research also employs an opinion-based weighting system that prioritizes its preferred &ldquo;best practices,&rdquo; which include business models, activities, processes, and structure.

".com",".com","","<p>Source: Forbes.com (June, 2019). Data provided by SHOOK&trade; Research, LLC. Data as of 3/31/19. America&rsquo;s Next Generation ranking was developed by SHOOK Research and is&nbsp;based on in-person and telephone due diligence meetings to evaluate each advisor qualitatively, a major component of a ranking algorithm that includes: client retention,&nbsp;industry experience, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and quantitative criteria, including: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms.&nbsp;Investment performance is not a criterion because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Rankings are based on&nbsp;the opinions of SHOOK Research, LLC and not indicative of future performance or representative of any one client&rsquo;s experience. Neither Forbes nor SHOOK Research receives&nbsp;compensation in exchange for placement on the ranking. The financial advisor does not pay a fee to be considered for or to receive this award. This award does not evaluate&nbsp;the quality of services provided to clients. This is not indicative of this financial advisor&rsquo;s future performance.</p>","CUSTOM"

<p>Source:&nbsp;Forbes.com&nbsp;(February, 2017). &nbsp;America&rsquo;s Top Women Wealth Advisors ranking was developed by SHOOK Research and is based on in-person and telephone due&nbsp;diligence meetings and a ranking algorithm that includes: client retention, industry experience, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and quantitative criteria,&nbsp;including: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms. Investment performance is not a criterion because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and&nbsp;advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Rankings are based on the opinions of SHOOK Research, LLC and not indicative of future performance or representative of&nbsp;any one client&rsquo;s experience. &nbsp;Neither Forbes nor SHOOK Research receives compensation in exchange for placement on the ranking. Approximately 7% of the nominees received this award. For more information:&nbsp;www.SHOOKresearch.com.&nbsp;</p>
